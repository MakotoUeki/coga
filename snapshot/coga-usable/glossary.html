              <p>People with age related forgefulness have impaired memory issues that can be a normal part of healthy aging. They may take longer to learn new things, forget something but remember it later, or occasionally forget particular words. (This differs from dementia where forgetfulness is due to a  disorder and is more pronounced.)</p>

              <p>Autistic people have some degree of impaired social behavior, communication and language abilities. This may also impact the person’s ability to regulate behavior and attention.
