   <p> This section aims to help people work with users with cognitive and learning disabilities. It focuses on:</p>
    <ul><li>
   special considerations and support for professionals working with this group, and
   </li><li> a brief introduction support for people who are new to usability testing (as any amount of user involvement can substantially improve accessibility).

Note that you can find additional information about including users with disabilities at <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/involving-users/">Involving Users in Evaluating Web Accessibility</a> and other useful resources on our <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/wiki/Developer_resources">developer resource page</a>.</p></div>
    <p>Usability testing is the best way to know if your content and design works for real people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-71" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations. Taken together they refer to:">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>. </p>
    <p>Usability is important for everyone. However, if someone cannot use the content or design without help because of their disability, then the content is not accessible for them. It is important to change the design so that users with cognitive and learning disabilities can use the content independently.</p>
    <p>Including digital accessibility throughout a project, right from the beginning, improves accessibility for all users. Include people with cognitive and learning disabilities in focus groups, user needs, design patterns (repeated designs for controls and other elements) and usability testing.</p>
    <p>Automated testing for accessibility focuses on more technical areas of accessibility. While important, automated testing often cannot  assess if people with a cognitive or learning disability can use the content. It is vital for people with cognitive and learning disabilities that development teams do not rely solely on automated accessibility testing. Development teams should</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Perform usability tests with people who have cognitive and learning disabilities. Usability testing of wireframes, conceptual drawings of the interface, or template pages can be helpful to identify challenges early in the project. You probably know people with <a href="#dfn-age-related-forgetfulness" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-age-related-forgetfulness-11" title="People with age related forgefulness have impaired memory issues that can be a normal part of healthy aging. They may take longer to learn new things, forget something but remember it later, or occasionally forget particular words. (This differs from dementia where forgetfulness is due to a disorder and is more pronounced.)">age related forgetfulness</a>, or a cognitive and learning disability.  Asking them to help find out if your design is usable is a good first step.</li>
      <li>Include people with cognitive and learning disabilities in their teams and the design and development process. This also includes research that has something to do with them. They are the experts in what works for them.</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Sometimes designs and content are usable for some people, but not if they have cognitive or learning impairments. Sometimes content is usable by people with one cognitive and learning disability but not a different one. For example, content with fewer words and more numbers may be perfect for some <a href="#dfn-autistic" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-autistic-3" title="Sometimes called “autism spectrum disorder”, “ASD”, “autism”, “asperger syndrome”, and “pervasive developmental disorder”.">autistic</a> and dyslexic users. However, the same content is inaccessible for people with dyscalculia who struggle with numeric information. It is important that usability testing includes a diverse set of users with different cognitive and learning disabilities, such as: people with a memory impairment, learning difficulty, attention impairment, numeric impairment, language and communication disability, and intellectual disability.</p>

<h3 id="x5-2-finding-people-to-include"><bdi class="secno">5.2 </bdi>Finding People to Include<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#finding-people-to-include"></a></h3>

<p>Finding people to include in usability testing who have different  <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-72" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations. Taken together they refer to:">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> is strongly encouraged and can be achievable, even for small groups on a low budget. If your organization already involves users, this section aims to expand that activity to include people with cognitive and learning disabilities. For developers without formal user involvement, even a small amount of user input and testing can make a large difference to usability and accessibility. Further links about user testing and usability can be on our <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/wiki/Developer_resources">developer resource page</a>.</p>

<p>People sometimes recruit users from an organization or self-help group for people with learning difficulties. Social media groups can be a convenient resource. Small development groups can achieve a large improvement by asking people who they know, such as friends, colleagues, relatives or neighbors. Try to build a group of users who:</p>

<ul>
<li>are older and struggle to use computers, or have <a href="#dfn-age-related-forgetfulness" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-age-related-forgetfulness-12" title="People with age related forgefulness have impaired memory issues that can be a normal part of healthy aging. They may take longer to learn new things, forget something but remember it later, or occasionally forget particular words. (This differs from dementia where forgetfulness is due to a disorder and is more pronounced.)">age-related forgetfulness</a>,</li>
<li>may be at an early stage of dementia,</li>
<li>have a specific learning disability such as those with dyslexia, dyscalculia, or <a href="#dfn-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-ad-h-d" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-ad-h-d-4" title="Attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder or AD(H)D involves difficulty focusing on a single task, focusing for longer periods, or being easily distracted.

<li>have an intellectual disability, or</li>
<li>have acquired cognitive issues (for example, due to neurological trauma). </li>
</ul>
<p>People with acquired cognitive issues have the same challenges as people with other disabilities such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>having difficulty (asking a family member to help) with booking travel booking or hotel booking online,</li>
<li>being unable to use online banking,</li>
<li>coping with content forms and pop-up windows when errors occur.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is helpful to find people with learning and cognitive difficulties who are also in your target group as customers or users.</p>
<p>If your organization has a more formal process, work with those that help employees or community members get assistive technology or other accommodations. They can put out a call for volunteers to their contacts. This helps individuals self-identify and opt-in to help.</p>

<p>Some organizations also use peer-researchers who have cognitive and learning disabilities. Peer-researchers understand the perspective of people with their disabilities. The researchers and developers work together with peer researchers to find solutions. Peer researchers are also involved in testing the solution with other people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-73" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations.

<section id="informed-consent">
<h3 id="x5-3-informed-consent"><bdi class="secno">5.3 </bdi>Informed Consent<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#informed-consent"></a></h3>
<p>It is important to get a declaration of consent from all participants involved in testing and focus groups before they start. Before they sign up, participants must know and understand the details such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the project is for.</li>
<li>What they will be doing and why it is helping you.</li>
<li>Any risks that need to be explained and understood.</li>
<li>What personal details are collected and how any personal data may be used. (Note that their comments should be anonymized before being used in any report.)</li>
<li>They do not have to participate. Participation is always voluntary and they can always stop at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your tester has a guardian, you should get informed consent from <strong>both </strong>the tester and their guardian.</p>
<p>Using an understandable consent form is important. Our design patterns on clear content will help you use clear language and layout. Adding icons and symbols can also help.</p>
<p>Make sure users understand the consent form. This can be done by asking them some questions about the consent that tests that they understand the key points. You can also adapt the example consent forms from <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/wiki/Developer_resources">our developer resource page</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout the process, remind them that participation is always voluntary and they can stop at any time. This is particularly important if they have <a href="#dfn-memory-impairment" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-memory-impairment-7" title="Memory impairment refers to an inability to recognize or recall pieces of information or skills that are usually remembered. It can affect:">memory impairments</a> and may have forgotten that it is their choice to participate. Remember to thank them for their ideas and contribution.</p>
<p>Different areas may require consent for more items than others. Check the legal requirements in your jurisdiction and for your type of content.</p>

<h3 id="x5-4-usability-testing"><bdi class="secno">5.4 </bdi>Usability Testing<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#usability-testing"></a></h3>
<p>One approach to usability is to measure user efficacy, efficiency, and satisfaction for key tasks. This can be done by measuring or tracking:</p>
<ul>
<li>successes in completing tasks while noting any errors to measure efficacy,</li>
<li>time taken per task to measure efficiency. Note that the relative time between tasks is often more useful than absolute numbers, and</li>
<li>user’s mood and comments to measure satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the evaluation you should be able to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>What prevents the user from completing a task?</li>
<li>What creates confusion? When and why do they misinterpret the interface?</li>
<li>What produces an error and an incorrect action?</li>
<li>When does the user get frustrated or upset?</li>
<li>When does the user misunderstand navigation, menus, and controls?</li>
<li>How can these problems be avoided?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="x5-4-1-differences-from-usability-testing-with-the-general-population"><bdi class="secno">5.4.1 </bdi>Differences from Usability Testing with the General Population<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#differences-from-usability-testing-with-the-general-population"></a></h4>
<p>There are some differences when usability testing with people who have cognitive and learning disabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask ahead of time if they need any support for their needs. This could include a quiet room or frequent breaks.</li>
<li>Ask what test methods work best for them, such as individual interviews or groups. Some people will prefer to have an interview in their home.
</li>
<li>Ensure participation forms are easy to understand. Confirm that they understand any key points.</li>
<li>Inform the participant that they can request the information in a different format. If they make a request, ensure they receive it with enough time for them to review and ask questions.</li>
<li>Have a copy of the participation forms at the session, in case questions come up before the session begins.</li>
<li>Send participation forms to the participant in advance. Allow plenty of time for the participant to ask questions and fill in forms.</li>
<li>Allow the participant to bring a caregiver, family member, or friend to attend with them.</li>
<li>If your tester has a guardian, you should get consent from both the participant and their guardian.</li>
<li>If they bring a guardian or caregiver, make sure they are not doing the tasks for them. If they give help, monitor closely what help they give, as this may be due to a design fault.</li>
<li>Explain the testing method before the test.</li>
<li>The questions should be short and easy to understand language.</li>
<li>Provide easy methods of assessing mood, rather than just asking for the participant. Try asking them to select a smiley face, such as:<em> Figure 1 A simple mood selector</em>.<br><br>


  <figure id="fig-a-simple-mood-selector">
                  <img src="img/faces-happy-to-sad.png" width="200" alt="a set of 5 smiley faces from happy, through neutral, to sad.">
                  <figcaption>Figure <bdi class="figno">1</bdi> <span class="fig-title">A simple mood selector</span></figcaption>
                </figure>
        </li>
<li>Some individuals also have challenges identifying moods from faces. Other options to consider are simple mood selectors and text-based rating scales where an individual can point to their selection. For example, I really like this, it is fine, I really don’t like this.</li>
<li>Check they understand the methods used to collect the data.</li>
<li>Ensure the person does not feel like they are at fault for making mistakes. While this is always important during usability testing, this scenario is even more likely for people with cognitive and learning disabilities.</li>
<li>Ask them for their ideas, such as, what features they would like to see, what design they prefer and what support they find most helpful. Thank them for their contribution.</li>
<li>Make clear that the tester can end the user testing session at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some suggestions of what to look for when conducting usability testing with people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-74" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations. Taken together they refer to:">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Before you start, make sure the research team understands that the testers cannot do anything wrong. Research should never harm the user or make them feel bad.</li>
    <li>Make sure the participants and researchers know they can leave at any time. No one should feel bad if they leave!</li>
    <li>Check that the testers understand the task or question. Encourage your testers to “think out loud”. </li>
    <li>Time the task takes to complete, and note any parts where users slow down or seem to struggle. Can your testers manage each task reasonably easily and quickly?  Also, note any errors that they make, including clicking on the wrong item.</li>
    <li>Find out if completing the task is frustrating or upsetting.
      <ol>
      <li>You can ask users how they are feeling before and after the tasks or rate their mood such as selecting the smiley face which represents how they feel.</li>
      <li>Ask them if anything was annoying.</li>
      </ol></li>
    <li>Ask how you can make it better for your users (people with cognitive and learning disabilities)?</li>
    <li>Ask your users if they have suggestions about what would make the interface easier for them to use. This is often best at the end of the usability test. </li>
    <li>If the user is struggling, remind them that you are reviewing the system not them and that their insights are really helpful. Thank them for helping. Remind them that it is helpful when they find issues because it helps the team make the product better. Stop the process if users are getting distressed.</li>
    <li>Analyze the data collected and review the findings with the team. Remember to keep the names of individuals confidential (unless they have given permission for their identity and disability to be shared).</li>
    </ol>

<section id="test-objectives">
<h3 id="x5-5-test-objectives"><bdi class="secno">5.5 </bdi>Test Objectives<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#test-objectives"></a></h3>
<p>You can test the objectives of the design guide. If they are successful, that section can be considered completed!</p>

<p>For each objective, make sure your user testing includes individuals with a range of cognitive and learning disabilities. Do not just ask questions, but ask the user to complete an action that demonstrates usability. Test for the following but set up the tests so that the user demonstrates their knowledge and understanding rather than answers a simple question:
Are enough user groups represented?</p>
<p>For example, a typical project may wish to include: People living with <a href="#dfn-early-stage-dementia" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-early-stage-dementia-6">early stage dementia</a>, <a href="#dfn-age-related-forgetfulness" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-age-related-forgetfulness-13" title="People with age related forgefulness have impaired memory issues that can be a normal part of healthy aging.
