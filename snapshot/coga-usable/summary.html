		<p>To help web content providers meet the needs of people with cognitive and learning disabilities we have identified the following objectives:</p>
		<ol>
		<li><img src="./img/Noun_clear_2594014.svg" alt="" width="40" height="40">
		<strong>Help users understand what things are and how to use them.</strong> This often involves using things that are familiar to the user so that they do not have to learn new symbols, terms or design patterns. People with cognitive disabilities often need predictable behavior and design patterns. For example, they may know the standard convention for hyperlinks (underlined and blue for unvisited; purple for visited).</li>
		<li><img src="./img/Noun_find_1164217.svg" alt="" width="40" height="40">
		<strong>Help users find what they need.</strong> Navigating the system should be easy. The layout should be clear and easy to follow with good visual cues like symbols. Using clear headings, boundaries and regions also help let people understand the page design.</li>
		<li><img src="./img/Noun_menu_58729.svg" alt="" width="40" height="40">
		<strong>Help users understand with clear text and images.</strong> This includes easy words, short sentences and blocks of text, clear images, and easy to understand video.</li>

		<li><img src="./img/Noun_Summary_Report_2642563.svg" alt="" width="40" height="40">
		<strong>Provide support for different ways to understand content.</strong> Graphics, summaries of long documents, adding icons to headings and links and alternatives for numbers are all examples of extra help and support.</li>

		<li><img src="./img/Noun_mistake_2809535.svg" alt="" width="40" height="40">
		<strong>Help users avoid mistakes.</strong> A good design will make errors less likely. Do not ask the user for more things then you need! When errors do occur the user should find it easy to correct them.</li>

		<li><img src="./img/Noun_focus_2640065.svg" alt="" width="40" height="40">
		<strong>Help users to maintain focus.</strong> Avoid distracting the user from their task. If they do get distracted, headings and breadcrumbs can help orientate the user and help the user restore the context when it is lost. (Making breadcrumbs clickable can also help the user undo mistakes.)</li>

		<li><img src="./img/Noun_Login_624752.svg" alt="" width="40" height="40">
		<strong>Ensure processes do not rely on memory.</strong> Avoid memory barriers that stop people with cognitive disabilities from using content. This includes long passwords to log in and voice menus that involve remembering a specific number or term. Make sure there is an easier option for people who need it.</li>

		<li><img src="./img/Noun_support_2690278.svg" alt="" width="40" height="40">
		<strong>Make it easy to get human help and give feedback.</strong> If users have difficulty sending feedback, then you will not know if they are able to use the content or when they are experiencing problems.</li>

		<li><img src="./img/Noun_personalization_1577466.svg" alt="" width="40" height="40">
		<strong>Support adaptation and personalization.</strong> People with cognitive disabilities often use add-ons or extensions as assistive technology. Sometimes, extra support requires minimal effort from the user via personalization that allows the user to select preferred options from a set of alternatives. Support personalization when you can. Do not disable add-ons and extensions!</li>

		<li><img src="./img/Noun_senior_citizens_23106.svg" s="" alt="" width="40" height="40">
		<strong>Test with real users!</strong> Involve people with disabilities in the research, design and development process. They're the experts in what works for them. This includes involving people with cognitive and learning disabilities in:
		<ul>
		<li>focus groups</li>
		<li>usability tests</li>
		<li>the design and research team.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		</ol>
