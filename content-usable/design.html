      <p>
        Making websites and applications friendly for people with
        cognitive and learning disabilities affects every part of design and development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accessibility has traditionally focused on the making the user interface
        usable for people with sensory and physical impairments in vision,
        hearing and/or mobility. Some accessibility features that help these user groups also help people
        with cognitive impairments. People with
        cognitive and learning disabilities also need improvements to context, language, usability, and other
        more general factors that impact everyone to some degree. As a result,
        they do not fit well into traditional accessibility standards.
		
      </p>
      <p>
        This document provides assistance making websites and
        applications friendly for people with cognitive and learning disabilities by
        providing you with guidance for your designs and design process.
      </p>
      <p>
       This guide is divided into design themes. Each theme includes user stories, testing 
	   methodologies, and design checkpoints. Just understanding the 
	   themes and user stories may help you make your content more accessible to some 
	   users with cognitive and learning disabilities. Please see the section on user 
	   testing for guidance on how to perform COGA user testing.

          Please note this document is not the final draft. We are still working
          on harmonizing the content and the internal consistency of the terms
          and style. The task force also intends to redo the tables to make them
          consistent with the design patterns (such as in 5.1 and 6.1). In
          addition, design patterns 2.8, 2.9, 2.6 and 2.10 2.13 and 5.3 and 5.6
          need to be checked for overlap. In addition, we are exploring the
          addition of these sections:

      <h2>
        Objective: Help users understand what things are and how to use them
      </h2>
      <p>
        Not everyone finds learning new things easy, and not everyone can
        remember new designs.  To use a site or application, people need to know what all
        controls and element are on each page and how to use them. Fewer people can use 
		sites and applications that require users to figure out how to use controls or interact with the page. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Many users, including users with mild cognitive impairment or dementia, cannot easily learn new design metaphors or remember things
        they learned. Without these skills, it can be much harder or impossible to find what
        they need, work out what controls do and how to use them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many users can be overwhelmed by too many options or too much
        information. If an individual's reading is slow, then too much
        information without structure and organization will make it difficult or impossible to use
        the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using familiar design patterns, terms and symbols is key to
        helping users who struggle to remember new
        symbols and design. Users need the following to be familiar:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Element location:</strong> Place elements in expected locations. For example,
          people may look for the search on the top right hand corner of a page.
          If it is somewhere else, it will be hard to find.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Symbols:</strong> Use familiar symbols. For example, people may look for a
          question mark for help. If you use a different symbol, fewer people
          will find help.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Text:</strong> Use familiar terms. For example, some people have a limited
          vocabulary. Uncommon terms may cause them difficulty.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Getting help:</strong> Always make it easy to find help.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Personalization can be extremely useful for designers who want to offer
        familiarity and flexibility. Familiarity helps users with cognitive and
        learning disabilities but is often based on the needs of the individual
        user. Personalization allows users to customize their interface, which
        is important as what is familiar for one user may not be familiar to
        another.
      </p>

        <h3>User testing</h3>
        <p>
          Make sure your user testing includes individuals with a range of
          cognitive disabilities. Do not just ask questions, but ask the user to
          complete an action that demonstrates usability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Test for the following but set up the tests so that the user
          demonstrates their knowledge and understanding rather than answers a
          simple question:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Does the user know what the page is about?</li>
          <li>Does the user know what actions they can take on a page?</li>
          <li>
            Does the user know where they are in a website, an application or a
            multi-step process?
          </li>
          <li>Can the user easily find the different sections of content?</li>
          <li>
            Identify the different activities that the user may want to complete
            on the page:
            <ul>
              <li>Can the user achieve the activities without asking for help?</li>
              <li>
                Does the user make errors trying to achieve the activities?
              </li>
              <li>Does the user find them easy to achieve?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
     
      <section>
        <h3>Pattern: Make the purpose of your page clear</h3>
        <p>
          Use a clear title or heading that summarizes the purpose of a page, or
          other clear signposts that have been tested by users with cognitive
          disabilities.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            This helps many people, including those with poor memory and
            attention as well as anyone who is easily distracted due to
            age-appropriate forgetfulness and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
            Disorder. 
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, someone with mild dementia is using online shopping.
            They get distracted and then when they look at the screen again they
            have forgotten what they were doing. A clear heading at the top of
            each page shows clearly
            <strong>what the page is about and what they are doing</strong>.
          </p>
		  <p> In another example, a user with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
            Disorder is looking for information in a video. They can tell by the video title that this video is has the information they need.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>More details</h4>
          <p>Headings need to clarify the purpose of this specific page.</p>
		  <p>When possible, provide information to help users understand how they got to the page.  For example: breadcrumbs, clearly indicated on main navigation, highlighting currently selected tab, etc.)</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Examples</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Success</strong> example: Headings tell me exactly where I
            am.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Failure </strong>example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Headings do not clarify the steps in a form;</li>
            <li>
              Service not available... what service? I have to remember what I
              was doing to know what service this is about.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Pattern: Make each step clear</h3>
        <p>
          In a multi-step process, clearly indicate the steps completed, the
          current step and the steps pending. 
		  Make it clear what the user did to reach the current step, including important choices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure the current location and progress within a sequence is
          clear.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Clearly indicating the current location and progress helps a user
            who loses focus or gets distracted reorient to their current
            activity without reading a great deal of content or restarting.
            Providing information about the steps that need to be completed
            ensures that a user who may find a process difficult to complete can
            determine if they can successfully finish. 
          </p>
          <p>Examples include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              someone with dementia loses focus and then cannot remember what
              they were doing;
            </li>
            <li>
              someone with an attention disability gets distracted and then
              needs to pick up where they left off;
            </li>
            <li>
              someone with a learning disability is not sure if this application
              has too many steps and if they will manage. By seeing they are
              half-way through they can gauge if they can cope with the entire
              process.

        <section>
          <h4>Examples</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Success</strong> example: Using breadcrumbs to indicate the
            current steps in the process, important choices, as well as past and future steps.
          </p>
		  <p>
            <strong>Failure</strong> example: Completed steps and choices the user has made are hard to find without relying on memory (example: hidden behind accordions or a previous page).

          Pattern: Clearly identify controls and their use
        </h3>
        <p>Use a clear and recognizable design for controls. Make it clear what controls are and how to use them.</p>
		
		<p>Use a clear design for controls by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Using a common style on controls (for example: links being
            underlined);
          </li>
          <li>
            Using common design pattern on links and controls (for example:
            clicking on a link takes you to the page);
          </li>
          <li>
            Making all the borders of controls clear other than textual links
            (for example: a help icon has a border);
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensuring items that are not clickable do not look like links or
            controls.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When this is not possible, provide instructions that explain their
          use. Instructions should be on the same page or one click away and
          written in plain language.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Using common style and design pattern on controls makes it easier to
            recognize and understand how to use it. Controls are parts of web
            pages that do something, e.g. a link, button, checkbox. The goal of
            these controls is to have someone use them. For example, an older
            user with age appropriate forgetfulness takes longer to learn new
            designs. They go to an ecommerce site has boxes around the headers
            (such as "womens" or "sale") and simple large text for the "add to
            cart" button. They click on the headings and not on the add to cart.
            After a few failures they assume they cannot manage it and leave the
            site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some users have trouble when controls have a different look, color
            or shape than they have used before. For example, when links do not
            have underlines and blue or purple text (even if this appears with
            focus) some users will not know there is a link.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have difficulty with memory, it can be harder to use unique
            controls. It may be slower to find them on the page. And even if
            they work just a little differently than similar ones, some may need
            to relearn how to use them each time they need to use them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using typical controls on the page will help people know how to use
            them. When using more unique controls, include easy to follow
            instructions and make them easy to find. Regardless of how a user
            uses the page (vision, auditory, voice input) it should be easy to
            identify, understand and use the controls.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are designing a new control, make them easy to identify (I
            know they are there), understand (I know what they do), and use (I
            know how to use them). Test with people with different cognitive and
            learning disabilities. Use a simple style or have easy to follow
            instructions that explain their use.
          </p>

            is selected to be the primary link text color, other text on the
            page does not use this.

            Links without an underline or usual blue text color (or purple for

        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Sometimes users are about to press a control and the control moves.  As a result, users with slow hand-eye coordination and
			processing speed may hit the wrong control causing an unwanted action and 
			disorientation.  For example, a user prepares to press a button on a video. The orientation changes to landscape and the control moves. 
			Because the user has slow eye tracking or hand-eye coordination, they end up pressing a link to a new video. 

          </p>
          <p>
            Shifting controls and content also can cause cognitive overload and increase mental fatigue.
			For example, as a user with Traumatic Brain Injury reads content, the content refreshes 
			and an additional article appears above the current content. The article the user is reading moves down. The user becomes disoriented 
			and the application becomes very hard to use or understand.

				<ul><li>Links in a list shifting positions</li>
					<li>Orientation changes</li>
					<li>Slow loading of a page that the user thinks is complete</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Note that if controls shift because of an action the user, and the user will not be trying to activate a moving control, 
				it is usually not problematic. For example, form controls shift down while a user types  text into a text box above the controls or when the user expands a section.</p>

        <h3>Pattern: Make the  relationship clear  between controls and what they affect</h3>
        <p>
          When controls affect a part of the content, the relationship between controls and affected content should be completely clear and unambiguous.  
        </p>
        <p>This can be achieved through:</p>
			<ul><li>Visually grouping controls with the content they relate to and/or including controls within the region they affect;</li>
			<li>Using clear dividers and/or white space between region in a page that may have separate controls or a scroll bar;</li>
			<li>Avoiding multiple or nested scrolling areas;</li></ul>

        
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Controls that affect only one section of a page is confusing. Many users will look again at the content, try and work out what they are supposed to do, and discover the correct controls or scrollbar. However, many people with cognitive or learning disabilities will not be able to work out what they did incorrectly. Others will feel cognitive overload, and will give up as a result. They may assume the application is broken, or that it is just too complicated for them. For all of these users, the application will not be usable.   
          </p>
          <p>
            Having a border or other visual cue around the controls and the relevant page section make it more understandable. If the controls cannot be next to the area they affect, check with user testing that the users with cognitive and learning disabilities find all the page relationships clear and immediately know how to use the controls.
          </p>
          <p>
            This helps people with cognitive disabilities that impact problem solving skills, those that get overwhelmed when presented with a lot of text, and those with difficulties with more complicated tasks. This can include some individuals with early stages of dementia, people who have had a concussion or a stroke, people with intellectual disabilities, and others. Those impacted may not complete tasks, miss key information, and not return to pages that are complicated to use and understand. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Do not have two scroll bars close together. Some users may find it difficult to determine which one to use with a particular section of content. Instead, use clear visual layout and placement of the scroll bars, break the content into two separate pages, or consider removing unnecessary information from the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, consider a user living with dementia trying to work out which scrollbar to use if there are more than one embedded in scrollable regions. When they try the wrong scrollbar, they do not get the effect they desire and their content may seem to disappear. If a website has 2 scrollbars; each operates a different section. When users try the wrong scroll bar, they do not get the effect they desire.

              <strong>Separating Interactive Elements</strong> - Place interactive elements like scroll bars and buttons close to the content they can impact. Also, keep interactive elements further from content to which they do not apply. This makes it easier to identify which elements will impact each section of content.

          familiar to most users.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Many users, such as those with mild cognitive impairment or
            dementia, cannot easily learn and remember new design metaphors.
            Without these skills, it can be much harder or impossible to locate
            desired items to interact with, and to know what interactions may
            do. Users can feel lost or overwhelmed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because common design elements are repeated often over a long period
            of use across many sites, users are more likely to recognize the
            interactions needed.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Links that look like links and buttons look and act like buttons:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  For example, underline links with a standard style throughout
                  a page;

        <h3>Pattern: Use a consistent visual design</h3>
        <p>Use a consistent visual design across groups of pages.</p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Those with difficulty understanding how to interact with information
            need to use cues like color, layout and other visual information to
            help them know where to look, what they should do and how they
            should complete that task.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, an older user with age appropriate forgetfulness takes
            a long time to learn new designs. When they come to a site, the
            first page takes time to understand, but then they know what to do
            on the next page. If the next page is different from the first and
            also difficult to learn, they become tired and make more mistakes,
            as they move to a third page the cognitive load becomes too much and
            they cannot complete the task. This pattern helps by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ensuring a consistent user experience by providing familiarity and
              building confidence;
            </li>
            <li>Making it possible to easily use and interact with content;</li>

              consistent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Headings with the same structural level have the same font and

        <h3>Pattern: Use symbols that help the user</h3>
        <p>
          Add familiar symbols (icons, images and pictographs) to important content such as controls and section headings.
          Each symbol should convey a single meaning and be adjacent to the content it relates to.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            People who have language comprehension difficulties who may be able
            to mechanically read but not understand the content or those who
            have learning and/or reading difficulties may rely on symbols to
            understand content and navigate to content they need. 
			Symbols also help people who struggle with language and attention to navigate content, including media.
		  </p>
          <p>
            For example, a person with aphasia, has the intellectual ability to
            understand concepts, but struggles with language. They may be
            dependent on the use of symbols to browse pages for information.
          </p>
          <p>
            It can also help the elderly population who can find cluttered pages
            with dense text hard to read on a screen. Clear symbols and images
            that act as signposts to the text content can be very helpful.

        <h3>Pattern: Ensure the hierarchy of the site and menu structure is logical, easy to identify and navigate</h3>
        <p>
          It is easy to understand and use the site hierarchy and the overall menu structure. Sub-menu items are clearly associated with the main menu items under
          which they fall.
		  It is easy to know that sub-menu items are there and how to get to
          them. Users should be able to easily identify:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The site organization,</li>
		  <li>The menu and content structure,</li>
		  <li>That there are sub-menus and, if there are,</li>
          <li>How to reach sub-menu items.</li>		     
        </ul>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
         <p>
            Confusion can occur when visual hierarchy of information is not
            immediately apparent to the user. Distinction between levels in
            content hierarchy may be difficult to understand or perceive due to
            minimal type size or type weight differences or color differences
            that are not easily perceived or understood. Furthermore, hierarchy
            solely dependent on small unique design elements may create
            confusion.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a drop down accordion menu of additional sub-menu items
            may not be viewable without understanding it needs to be clicked (or
            ‘rolled over’) as indicated by a small unique design element.
          </p>
          <p>
            When opening a web page for the first time, the sub-menus are
            typically collapsed and their design may make it difficult to even
            know that they are there. Some users with cognitive disabilities may
            not guess that they are present, or after seeing one expand by
            accident, may not generalize that this structure may be present for
            other items in a menu. Making it easy to notice that there are
            sub-menu items ensures the user can use this part of your site. An
            example is a menu without any visual indication that there are
            sub-menu items.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are times where how to open the sub-menu item may not be easy
            for some with cognitive disabilities. If the control to expand a
            menu item relies on a particular gesture or way of rolling over the
            area with a mouse, for example, the end user may not figure out how
            to expand the sub-menu and may abandon the task. An example would be
            a menu that expands only after moving the mouse over a particular
            side of the menu text.
          </p>		  
        <section>
          <h4>More details</h4>
          <p>
            Small design elements that indicate sub-menu items will be presented
            that aren’t always readily apparent or meaningful to the user and
            not universally adopted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples include a chevron (triangle). In different designs it can
            be either left facing right facing, up facing or down facing
            depending on state and the unique design standard affecting
            interpretation of state.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confusion can occur when a right facing chevron can indicate that
            more information will be presented on the current page when clicked
            or it may mean that information is currently being presented, or it
            may indicate that it takes the user to a new page. Consistent and
            general best practices should be used to make it understandable to
            the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, a series of these nested elements on a long page can
            create visual hierarchy confusion if dependent solely on
            interpretation of design elements.

          <ul>
            <li>
              The presence of sub-menu items is easy to find because there are
              triangles next to their menu items.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Failure</strong> example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              No visual indication of sub-menu items is next to the menu item.
              The only way to discover the presence of the sub-menu item if
              using a mouse is to move the mouse over the location of the
              sub-menu item;
            </li>
            <li>
              Expanding to view the sub-menu items requires interaction by mouse
              with a specific area of the menu item, and this area is not
              visually distinguished.

        <h3>Pattern:  Use a clear and understandable page structure</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            Using clear dividers between different sections in a page such as call out boxes, navigation bars, and advertisements. Note that controls and scrolls should be clearly and uniquely identified with the region they affect.
          </li>
          <li>
            Providing clear headings and visual cues that indicate the purpose of the sections;

		  Making the relationship between different parts of the page clear. Use visual indicators to help people identify:

  				<li>Items that have a different purpose to surrounding information</li>
		  </li>
        </ul>

        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            By creating clear layouts, with easy to use controls, users can focus on the task instead of spending time figuring out how to use the controls and information. They easily find key information, and are more likely to return to the page. Clear layout helps people with cognitive and learning  disabilities that  impact problem solving skills, get overwhelmed when presented with a lot of text,  impact problem solving skills, those that and those with difficulties with more complicated tasks
          </p>
          <p>
           Some people with disabilities need a clear layout to help them know how to use the information. When structure and relationships are unclear, users may need to experiment with different layouts and structures until they work out how to use them. However, people with cognitive disabilities may not be able to do so, and may not be able to use the content or application. Those impacted may not complete tasks, miss key information, and not return to pages that are complicated to use and understand.
          </p>
		  
		  <h5>A good structure</h5>
			<p>
			A clear organization of content into pages and sections with obvious purpose allows users to more easily locate relevant sections and to be confident that those they read in detail will match their purposes. Each page or section of content should be organized and marked so that its purpose is obvious. This might be through the use of visual cues, headings or labels or even a pyramid style of writing. Sometimes symbols (with alt text) can be used to make the sections purpose clear. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Content that is not directly relevant to the main purpose of a page should be distinctly separated and programmatically determinable. There should be no need to read all the content in case something important is missed. For example, ads that appear in-line in a section of content are rarely related to the purpose of a section and can be placed in a separate delimited section. 
			</p>

		  <h5>Visual cues</h5>
			<p>
			People who have difficulty with recognizing or comprehending written language, having difficulties with concentration or memory can find it easier to process graphical cues.
			</p>
			<p>
			Visual of grouping of information is based on the psychological principle of Common Regions. It has been found that the grouping information using a border or color shading makes it easier for people to identify groups, even if the content of the group is not similar.
			</p>
			<img
            alt="Example of the Common Regions grouping principle. picuture1"
            src="img/common-region-1.png"
			/>
			<img
            alt="Example of the Common Regions grouping principle. picuture2"
            src="img/common-region-2.png"
			/>
			<p>Figures: Example of the Common Regions grouping principle.</p>
			
			<p>
			These graphical indicators allow people to identify structure and information types without reading text or have problems distinguishing groups of information. Using the graphical indicators consistently to indicate similar types of items aids with navigating content and reduces the cognitive load. Note that symbols are  also helpful visual indicators. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Note that controls that affect only one section of a page can be confusing. Having a border around the controls and the relevant page section is helpful. If the controls cannot be next to the area they affect, check with user testing that the users find all the page relationships clear and immediately know how to use the controls.
			</p>
			<p>
			For multimedia, each section should have a clear and descriptive heading. The user should be able to jump to each section. 
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Example 1:</strong> Chunks of content run into each other with a "flat design". Whereas some users can work out which chunks belong together, many users with cognitive disabilities will find it challenging or impossible. Thus, all the benefits of chunking content are lost.
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Example 2:</strong> An elementary school publishes a weekly newsletter with interesting stories about activities and important announcements. Important announcements include early school dismissal. If the newsletter has a good heading structure, it will be easier for a parent who is a slow reader to find the important announcements about early school dismissal. Without a good heading structure, the important early dismissal information can be easily missed.
			</p>
			
			<p>Examples of how this pattern will help people:</p>
			<ul><li>A person with memory issues may need a clear heading structure to stay focused.</li>
			<li>Someone with an attention disability gets distracted and then needs to pick up where they left off and headings help.</li>
			<li>A slow reader may depend on a heading structure to find important information they need without forcing them to read the whole document.</li>
			<li>A user on the autism spectrum can identify graphical indicators and the use of color for grouping content but struggles with the labels and heading text.</li>
			<li>A user living with dementia is distracted and then cannot remember what they were doing. The visual cues help them re-orientate themselves on the page. </li>
			</ul>
        </section>
		        <section>
          <h4>More details</h4>
			<p>Making regions and a good page structure can include:</p>
				<ul><li>If pages are dense with content, check that  content is grouped  and you can see what is related.</li>
					<li>Clearly label content categories, and use visual cues and symbols which will be familiar.  This will help recognition and retrieval rather than rely on memory of your site.</li>
					<li>The heading structure should create an outline of the document that could serve as an abstract of the whole document.</li>
					<li>Heading structure  and graphical indicators makes the content easier to scan and find more detailed information that a person needs at a moment.</li>
					<li>It is also important the graphical indicators do not clutter the interface and are used consistently as that can add an additional cognitive load for users to process. Examples of clear dividers include high contrast borders or white space. A change in background color can be a clear divider if the contrast is strong enough.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Examples of common graphical indicators and visual cues include:</p>
				<ul><li>Group summaries of content with images, such as using a card design using colors or white space;</li>
					<li>Flag important information, such as using call out boxes;</li>
					<li>Indicate different types of information, such as placing quotes in speech bubbles.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Graphical indicators should also be programmatically available to enable assistive technologies to interpret the graphical indicators.</p>
				<p>Sometimes the structure and relationships can be made clear through personalization or user agents and good use of semantics in the code (see WCAG 2.0 SC 1.3.1).</p>

        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Examples</h4>
		  <p><strong>Succcess </strong> example:</p>
				<p>A site that uses:</p>
				<ul><li>Separated Content With a Card Design and Symbols - White space, borders or call outs are used in addition to headings and symbols to help define sections of content. This organizes the information on the page so it is easier to determine layout and find specific information;</li>
				<li>Separated Interactive Elements - Place interactive elements like scroll bars and buttons close to the content they can impact. Also, keep interactive elements further from content to which they do not apply. This makes it easier to identify which elements will impact each section of content.</li></ul>
				<p>See GOV.UK. for an success example.</p>
		  
          <p><strong>Failure </strong> examples:</p>
          <p>Dense text, with little white space, no call outs, and a lack of visually differentiated headings to define sections;</p>

        <h3>Pattern: Break media into chunks</h3>
        <p>Divide long pieces of media into segments that are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>logical</li>
		  <li>short,</li>
          <li>labeled, and</li>
          <li>easy to reach or jump to.</li>
        </ul>
		<p>Provide a logical organization and structure that is easy to navigate.</p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Providing shorter logical segments allows a person to find and
            review a specific topic. If that person loses concentration or steps
            away, clear segmentation allows them to easily find their place in
            the material and start again. This is especially important for
            educational style content where review is often necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chunking media also allows for each segment to be given a unique URL
            and so easily referenced and shared.
          </p>
		  <p>Using a clear, logical structure allows users to orient and navigate through the content easily even if they get distracted.</li>

          <ul>

              Some videos can be naturally organized into chapters or segments
            </li>

        <h3>
          Pattern: Ensure the most important things are easy to find 
        </h3>

        <p>
          Design key content to visually stand out and be visible to users without
          needing to scroll the page or hover over content. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
		   <li>
            Critical tasks and the controls needed to complete them,
          </li>
          <li>
            Interactions for critical features (e.g. login forms, send buttons), and
          </li>
          <li>
            Important information (e.g. health warnings or information that can
            affect safety).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            People with low executive function, impaired memory, and other
            cognitive and learning disabilities may not be able to find features
            that require the use of the scroll bar or pointer hovers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users who are unfamiliar with the page (or common design patterns)
            rely on prominent visual styling aids to locate important
            information.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>More details</h4>
          <p>
            The amount of page visible before scrolling is dependent on a wide
            range of factors such as physical device size, resolution, pixel
            density and device setup.
          </p>
          <p>
            The size of the visible region will be site specific. Where
            possible, use site statistics to understand what technology users are
            using and keep this in mind when designing the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, an elementary school publishes a weekly newsletter with
            interesting stories about activities and important announcements.
            Important announcements include early school dismissal. If the
            newsletter includes less important information before the early school dismissal,
			a parent who reads slowly may give up before scrolling down to the important information.
			A clear heading structure can help with this by reducing what needs to be read. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In another example, a user is writing a comment, but the send button
            is not visible when the view focuses on the text area. As a result,
            she cannot see how to send her feedback. The company will then not
            receive any feedback from groups who are not able to find the
            feedback button.

          <h4>Getting started</h4>
          <p>
            Make it easy to find the most important things on the page. Identify
            key content and its placement early in the design process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Space at the top of the document is most likely to be visible to
            users without scrolling. Place key content at the top of the page to give the best experience to the widest range of users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider the most constrained user experience first (e.g., a 240px
            wide mobile phone) and then design upwards from there in order to
            account for the widest range of scenarios.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conducting user testing can identify common use cases and barriers.
            Adopting responsive development practices can improve the
            flexibility of the page to a range of different devices and
            stations.

            <li>
              A login form submit button stands out from other links and buttons

            <li>
              Critical health and safety information regarding medication
              visually stands out from other less important information on the

        <h3>
          Pattern: Make it easy to identify the most important tasks and features of the site 
        </h3>
        <p>Make important tasks and features on the site visually and programmatically prominent.  Techniques to do so include:</p>
		   <ul>
			<li>Calling out key tasks for the website on the home page</li>
				<ul><li>Dedicating call out boxes or sections of the home page to these tasks/features</li>
					<li>Giving the most important tasks/features visual weight</li>
					<li>Placing the tasks/features towards the top of the page so the user does not have to scroll to see them</li>
					<li>Placing the tasks/features toward the top of the content so assistive technology finds them quickly</li>
					<li>When appropriate, providing headings for each key task or feature</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Including them at a top level of the main navigation</li>
		   </ul>

		<section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            People with low executive function, impaired memory, and other cognitive and learning disabilities may have difficulty 
			determining what they can do on a site. By calling out important tasks and features, people can more quickly determine 
			whether the site will meet their needs. 
          </p>
		  
		  <p>For example, a user goes to website to buy the tickets. He sees many reviews and other information but cannot see 
		  how to buy the tickets. The user leaves the site.</p>

        </section>
		<section>
          <h4>More details</h4>
		<p>The most important tasks and features are:</p>
		<ul><li>The three tasks the users want to perform</li>
			<li>The three most common tasks (from the users' perspective)</li>
			<li>Tasks that affect the users' health or wellbeing</li></ul>
		<p>Usage data can normally identify the most common tasks. Focus groups and surveys are also useful for identifying what the users want.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Examples</h4>
            <p><strong>Success </strong>example: A library website includes the important tasks directly on the main page. The 
			advanced search box which allows users to search for books in the catalog is located towards the top of the home 
			page and a simple version which allows users to search the site or the catalog is in the main navigation. Important
			tasks such as signing up for a library card, locating a branch, and reserving a conference room are listed in the
			main navigation and included on the main page in visually distinct boxes. </p>
				
            <p><strong>	Failure</strong> example: A library website only includes upcoming events on the main page. Users have
			to click on a link titled Catalog before they can get to a search box to look for books. Signing up for a library card,
			locating a branch, and reserving a conference room are included on a page labeled About and are not easily visible 
			from the main navigation. 
			</p>
        </section>
      </section>   
      <section>
        <h3>Pattern: Provide search</h3>
        <p>Provide a friendly search capability. Ideally search should include:</p>
		<ul><li>Autocomplete</li>
			<li>Grouping of results when appropriate with headings for each group</li>
			<li>Ability to easily find previous searches</li>
			<li>Spell-checking</li>
		</ul>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Having a search capability allows users to find the content they
            need even if they cannot find the content using the site menus
            or other browsing mechanisms. A user can learn how to use search and
            reuse that skill on many sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            User studies have shown the aging population tends to rely on search
            to locate information rather than navigating menus or surfing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Menu systems and most site navigation require the user to
            understand the categories that the content provider has
            created for general use. Users with impaired executive function may
            be unable to identify the correct categories.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, users know the correct category via memory, rather
            than logic. For example, most users remember that the print function
            is often found under the file menu. Users with impaired memory may
            not be able to find these menu items based on recall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users with impaired short term memory or who are easily distracted may 
			also find navigating a site and going to many pages to look for content is
            difficult, as they may lose focus and forget what they are looking for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Search is most useful when it corrects misspellings, finds
            appropriate or related content and provides suggested auto-corrected
            versions of the search terms that the user can choose from.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h4>More details</h4>
          <p>
            Search is less important on small sites where every page is no more than
            two clicks away from the main page.

        <h3>Pattern: Let users go back</h3>
        <p>Always let the user return to a previous point.</p>
        <p>
          The standard back button is the best way to do this as it is familiar
          to the user. Many users will try the back button first. 
        </p>
        <p>The user should never lose their work if they press back.</p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Allowing users to return to a previous point helps prevent mistakes and makes it easy to
            correct mistakes when they happen.
          </p>
          <p>Examples of mistakes include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Touching a control by accident;</li>
            <li>Opening a new link by accident; and</li>
            <li>Closing a window the user intended to keep open.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If a person easily makes mistakes or makes them often, it is
            important that they can go back and make changes without having
            their work or previous choices deleted.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user is watching a video. They try to increase the
            volume but touch a different link instead. A new video now loads.
            The user can press the back button and return to the video they were
            watching before. They now know they can try and increase the volume
            and if they make a mistake, they can easily go back and try again.
          </p>
          <p>
            In another example, the back button did not work as expected, but
            took them somewhere else (such as the home page). When they try to
            change the volume or add a comment they often lose the video they
            were watching and cannot find the way to get back to it. The user now
            feels they cannot use any of the website's features in case they
            lose their main content again. They do not expand the screen, change
            the volume, or leave comments.
          </p>
          <p>
            In forms, each time the user has to re-enter data presents a new
            chance for mistakes to occur. Entering and re-entering data can be
            stressful and tiring from some people with learning and cognitive
            disabilities. This increases the likelihood of mistakes and may make
            it impossible to submit correct data and complete the intended task.
          </p>
          <p>
            For those with anxiety, memory challenges, and difficulty following
            directions, the ability to go back and review information they have
            entered is very important. For example, for some people the task of
            following directions and reviewing their answers works best as two
            separate tasks. Being able to enter information with their focus
            being on following the directions, and later going back to review
            their answers, helps them be more effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the user has an opportunity to go back and review the data they
            entered, even if submitted by mistake, it is easier to correct the
            information.

        <p>Streamline processes and workflows so that they include only the minimally

          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Streamlining processes and workflows reduces distractions, mistakes, and mental fatigue. 
			Using short critical paths increases the chance that users with cognitive disabilities can successfully and accurately 
			complete a process or task and navigate a workflow.

            <p><strong>Success </strong>examples:</p> 
			
			<p> 1. The steps included in the online process to buy movie tickets are:</p>

				<li>Select a movie</li>
				<li>Select the date and time</li>
				<li>Select seats</li>
				<li>Pay</li>
				<li>Print tickets</li>
				</ul>
			<p>The movie theater allows the user to view descriptions about the movie and ratings, buy snacks ahead of time, 
			and donate to a charity. These actions, or steps, are not required in order for the user to complete the task 
			of purchasing a movie ticket. Instead of requiring the user make these selections as part of the purchasing process, 
			the user is given these options before the process is started and after it is complete.</p>

           <p>The movie theater forces users to decide on snacks and making a charitable donation before paying for their tickets. 
		   While an opt out option is available, it is somewhat hidden on the screen, particularly on mobile devices, and

        <h3>User testing</h3>
        <p>
          Make sure your user testing includes individuals with a range of
          cognitive disabilities. Do not just ask questions, but ask the user to
          complete an action that demonstrates usability.
        </p>
        <p>Test for the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Does the user understandable use of text?</li>
          <li>Does the user understand text immediately?</li>
          <li>Does the user know unambiguous language?</li>
          <li>
            Is there any content usable without understanding math concepts?
          </li>
          <li>
            Is there any representation of math by words instead of numbers?
          </li>
          <li>Is there any support for slow readers?</li>
          <li>Does the user understand use of (familiar) symbols?</li>
          <li>Does the user understand use of images and multi-media?</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Pattern: Use clear words</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use common and clear words in all content. Look at the most common 1500 words or
            phrases. These are the terms that people with severe language
            impairments are most likely to know.
          </li>
          <li>Remove unnecessary words.</li>
          <li>
            Do not invent new words or give words new meanings in your
            application. Do not expect people to learn new meanings for words
            just to use your content. If you must create new terms, make sure the
            user has access to an explanation within one click or event.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            This benefits many people including those with language impairments,
            learning disabilities and a poor memory. Using uncommon words can make text and media difficult to understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            People with language impairments often have a reduced vocabulary and
            learning new terms is a very slow, difficult process. For other
            groups, such as people living with dementia, learning new terms is
            not realistic or possible. Using uncommon words, that they do not
            already know, will make the content incomprehensible [unable to be understood] and unusable.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, someone with mild dementia is trying to turn on an ICT
            heating and air conditioning unit. The menu item for selecting heat
            or air conditioning is labeled "mode". The user cannot use the whole
            unit because of this one term. This type of design has caused emergencies such as
            hypothermia.

        <h3>Pattern: Use a simple tense and voice</h3>
        <p>
          Use the tense and the voice that is easiest to understand. In English, this
          is usually the present tense and active voice. Speak directly to the
          user, and use the simplest form of verbs.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Using simple tense and voice benefits many people including those with language impairments,
            learning disabilities or a poor memory. For example, more people
            will understand “press the on button” (present tense and active
            voice) then “the on button should be pressed”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Active voice makes it clear who is supposed to take action. For example,
             “It must be done.” (passive voice) does not say who must act.
            “You must do it.” is active voice and clearly states who has the action.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>More details</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use other voices or tenses when they will be easier to understand or friendlier.
            </li>
            <li>
              In languages where present tense and active voice do not exist or
              are not the clearest option, use the tense and the voice that are easiest to
              understand.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are writing about past or future events, do not use the
              present tense. It will just be confusing.

        <h3>Pattern: Avoid double negatives or nested clauses</h3>
        <p>
          Use a simple sentence structure. Do not use a double negative to
          express a positive. Do not use clauses inside clauses. Both double negatives
		  and nested clauses can be confusing.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Simple sentence structure benefits many people including those with language impairments,
            learning disabilities or a poor memory. For example, a person with
            early stage dementia can manage their own appointments and affairs
            because the language is clear and understandable.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, more people will understand “You must get the agency’s
            approval before we can answer your claim”: rather than “No approval
            of any claims can be achieved without the agency’s approval”.

        <h3>Pattern: Use literal language</h3>
        <p>
          Use literal and concrete language. When possible, use concrete terms
          and examples that refer to objects or events that you can see, hear or
          touch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not use metaphors and similes unless you include an explanation.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Many people do not understand non-literal content. For example, a
            programmer with autism spectrum disorder may not understand jokes
            and similes. Sometime instructions have jokes and similes to make
            the content friendlier. However, this confuses the programmer
            who now cannot do her job as needed.
          </p>
          <p>You can explain any non-literal language by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Adding a simple language term in brackets next to any non-literal text such
              as a metaphors and similes;</li>
            <li>Providing a pop up definition; or</li>
            <li>
              Using supported mark up (see

              >).
            </li>
          </ul>
		  <p>In non-text media, explain non-literal as part of the media or include it in a separate file or track.</p>
		  
		  <div class="note">Should there be a special media track with explanations? Can we explore this and coordinate it?</div>

          <h4>More details</h4>
          <p>
            Make sure the meaning remains clear when you replace non-literal text with
			literal text. Check this when providing literal text
            in a popup or other alternative.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Getting started</h4>
          <p>
            Start by putting clear literal text on headings, labels,
            navigational elements, instructions, error messages and any content
            that may affect the user’s rights or wellbeing. This will increase
            the usability in critical places without changing your writing
            style.

        <h3>Pattern: Separate each instruction</h3>
        <p>
          In instructions, separate each step. Separate steps make instructions
          much easier to follow. Consider:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Using numbers and lists can also help;</li>
          <li>
            Providing complex instructions in an If/Then
            table, which can be easier to follow; or
          </li>
          <li>
            Using friendly graphics can help make instructions less scary;
          </li>
        </ul>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Step-by-step instructions benefits many people including those with language impairments,
            learning disabilities or a poor memory.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a person with a low working memory cannot hold onto
            many pieces of information at the same time. If they need to
            remember what they are doing, divide the steps and track what they
            have done they are much more likely to make mistakes. When
            instructions are clearly separated and laid out, users can follow
            them without making mistakes.

            text content makes it easier to read and understand. People with
            poor memory or anyone who is easily distracted will benefit.
            This also helps people with learning disabilities related to
            processing speed or language. Chunking is helpful to anyone who is
            multitasking.

          <p>
            Example: A graduate student with ADD may need to teach themselves a
            new software skill. The software documentation is broken up into
            short paragraphs and lists by topic. The student finds the
            documentation easy to read and understand.

              A series of three or more steps is easier to follow as a numbered

            DOTD Issues Winter Weather Travel Advisory for Calgary. With the
            possibility of snow and rain in the forecast throughout the holiday
            weekend, the Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD)
            announced that department staff is prepared to deal with winter
            weather. Maintenance forces will be on standby to apply sand and
            salt over any affected bridges and roadways, to remove fallen trees
            from the roadway, and to close any roads as needed. Interim
            Secretary Jane Doe urges motorists to take the threat of winter
            weather seriously. "In the event of adverse weather conditions, the
            department will strive to maintain access to highways and
            interstates; however, we encourage the motoring public to avoid
            traveling during snow and ice, if at all possible," said Doe. During
            winter weather conditions, the best thing motorists can do is drive
            slowly and carefully, and avoid driving while distracted. Always
            allow for extra driving time, reduce speeds when visibility is low,
            and make sure there is plenty of room between vehicles. Also, look
            out for black ice, which can form on bridges, overpasses, off- ramps
            and in shady spots. As always, DOTD reminds motorists to buckle up
            and refrain from drinking and driving. Citizens can get the latest
            updates on real-time traffic and road conditions by using the
            Traveler Information System simply by dialing ### from their
            telephone and saying the route or region about which they are
            seeking information. Travelers can also access this information by
            visiting the Traveler Information Website. Motorists can also obtain
            information regarding road closures by contacting DOTD’s Customer
            Service Center at (1-###-###-####). The center is open 7:30 a.m.- 5
            p.m. Monday through Friday.

        <h3>Pattern: Use white spacing</h3>
        <p>
          Put white space around objects and text, including boxes, paragraph
          headings, and content, so that each section is clearly separated.

        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            White space (also called negative space or the background color)
            reduces clutter and provides definition to content. This gives the
            viewer a clear overview of a web page. It is used by designers to
            enhance text and the position of objects on a page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using white space aids navigation through a page and helps people
            read it. It can help the user find important elements on a page. For
            those with cognitive impairments, white space has been shown to ease reading
            difficulties and improves understanding of content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Make sure users can also adjust the amount of white space around
            objects and text via a web extension or user setting. This supports
            the ability to identify important elements in the content of a web
            page.

            Allow for the ability to easily adjust white space around objects
            and text, including boxes, paragraph headings, and content, to a
            degree that suits the user and does not disrupt the overall
            integrity of a web page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that “white space” is a term that means the background color.

        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            For some readers, decoding words, numbers and symbols does not happen 
            automatically and can be demanding on working memory and executive
            functions. If they find content too demanding they are at risk of
            losing its meaning and the overall context of the message that is
            being conveyed. Some users may use assistive technology or
            personalization tools to reduce the cognitive demands of decoding
            content. An example would be text-to-speech that reads aloud content
            allowing for the use of auditory and visual channels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users should not need to decipher letters, numbers, and words becuase of formatting or punctuation errors. 
			They should be able to focus
            on understanding the meaning of the content, especially when they
            are using assistive technology or personalizing content. It is
            important that the content is created with these adaptations in
            mind, to ensure that all users gain the experience you want them to
            achieve. Content creators should ensure that information is provided
            in a way that can be read accurately by assistive technology. It may
            have to be personalized to suit certain users, but this can be
            achieved when all the elements are accessible.

            <strong>Use punctuation correctly</strong> for the language you are
            writing in, as it will affect how the stress and intonation (known
            as prosody) patterns from the text are heard, when converted into
            speech. For example, in English, commas and semicolons will result
            in a short pause in the speech, whereas a hyphen – will generally be
            ignored. Question marks, exclamation marks and speech marks can
            result in changes in intonation, such as a rise in the pitch of the
            voice.

            necessary then ensure they are marked up correctly, using techniques
            such as MathML and abbreviation expansions to provide additional
            support. Roman Numerals should be presented in upper case if used in
            isolation as they are likely to be read as individual letters

            Be aware that long numbers may be read as single digits or phrased
            as a single number. This is a particular problem for phone numbers
            or zip codes. While it is difficult to control exactly how these
            numbers are read aloud, content creators can help by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Displaying the content of the number and using HTML semantics to
              ensure users and assistive technologies are aware of the number’s
              purpose. In addition, the following recommendations can assist with
              improving text-to-speech rendering:
            </li>
            <li>
              For phone numbers, using the correct layout for the locality of
              the phone number and ensure users can select the whole phone
              number (including area code), so that text-to-speech voices can
              recognize the format and phrase it correctly.
            </li>
            <li>
              For Zip / Postal codes, including state or address information
              close to the number so that speech voices can expand known
              abbreviations (such as state names) and listeners can perceive the
              context.
            </li>
            <li>
              When writing long numbers, considering what separators will be
              familiar to your readers and how it will be read aloud. In
              general, English speaking countries will use commas between
              thousands and a period as the decimal separator whereas German and
              other European countries do the opposite. For example, 1,245 would
              represent one thousand two hundred and forty-five in English, but
              one point two four five in German. Text-to-speech output will
              assume the separators are being used in the format of the language
              of its voice. If this does not match the content, then listeners
              can become easily confused. While replacing thousand separators
              with a space has become a common convention to avoid confusion, it
              leads to difficulties with text-to-speech with long numbers being
              read out in a disjointed fashion. For example, 120 034 943 can be
              read as one hundred and twenty, zero three four, nine hundred and
              forty-three.

        <section>
          <h4>Examples</h4>
          <p>
            Consider how you write dates, because once again the text-to-speech
            will use the format associated with the language of the voice. A
            date such as 04/03/2019 will be read as “April 3rd 2019” by a US
            English voice and “4th of March 2019” by a British English voice.
            Writing out the month in words can avoid confusion.

        <p>
          Provide a brief summary for a long document. Emphasize any important
          keywords to help people understand the purpose and contents of the
          document, and determine if it might contain information they need.  
		  Also, provide a summary of media files so that users can identify the content they need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Summaries should use common words, short sentences and be written in
          an easy to understand style and tense.

        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Providing an easy-to-understand summary helps many people to quickly
            decide if the document is relevant to them and their current goal.
            A high level outline in a few sentences or bullet
            points is most effective. Abstracts and executive summaries are
            usually much longer and more detailed as they are designed to
            summarize the entire document.
          </p>
		  <p>For media, summaries help users with short attention

            The first section should be a text summary of the document. It may
            include links to other sections if appropriate. 
          </p>
		  <p>In media, summaries of each segment should include the main points included in the content.

        <h3>Pattern: Provide alternatives for numbers</h3>
        <p>Provide alternatives for numbers and numerical concepts.</p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>Not all people can understand numbers and numerical concepts.</p>
          <p>
            For example, some people have dyscalculia, a learning disability
            specifically-related to mathematics. People with dyscalculia have
            significant problems with numbers and mathematical concepts, but
            often excel in other intellectual areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user with dyscalculia may have difficulty processing
            temperature data when presented only in a numeric format. However,
            if non-numeric alternatives are provided (cold, warm, hot etc.) then
            they are able to understand the content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Numeracy issues can occur due to a range of disabilities, the most
            severe being the inability to read or understand numbers. Other
            people have challenges with any calculations such as relative sizes
            or times. When reading measurement an individual with cognitive
            impairment may understand the concept of 90cms as a length but find
            it hard to cope with the fact that 0.9m and 900mm are the same
            length.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a train schedule has a long list of relative times that
            they train leaves for different zones on the hour. The user cannot
            calculate when the next train leaves from their location.

        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Reading a sentence phrase by phrase conveys more meaning than reading individual words. 
			Phrases are also easier to comprehend. The more words an individual can process in one glance, 
			the faster they can read, the easier they can understand what’s written, and the more they stay interested. Most people can take in a whole 
			line of text, or more at once. Fixating on many words at a time is necessary for comprehension for many people. A slow reader may read a sentence slowly using 6 to 9 
			eye fixations, sometimes taking in only a single word (or less) at a time. Adding 
			background noise reduces the number of words readers can fixate on. Removing background noise helps users 
			comprehend more words at the same time.
          </p>
		  
		  <p>Also, automatic word recognition is used typically in tandem with phonetics to achieve full reading comprehension. 
		  For example, approximately 200 words exist in the English language that must be memorized, and automatically recognized, 
		  because they don't fit traditional letter sound patterns, in order to piece together strings of words into sentences. 
		  If a user can't recognize these words in 3 seconds, then the text is harder to understand. Background noise can increase the amount of time it 
		  takes users to recognize words.  </p>

        <h3>Pattern: Explain implied content</h3>
        <p>Provide definitions or explanations for implied content such:  </p>
		<ul><li>Body gestures</li>
		<li>Emotions</li>
		<li>Sarcasm</li>
		<li>Metaphors</li>
		<li>Facial expressions</li></ul>
		<p>These definitions and explanations should be provided in text close to the implied content or in the markup.</p>	
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
 		<p>Implied content can be difficult for some users because it requires them to:</p>
			<ul><li>Know where to look to get the information, and</li>
			<li>Understand the meaning behind what is being implied.</li></ul>
		<p>One example was a research study where people with autism were asked to watch a movie 
		that had a lot of implied communications. They were watching the actors’ mouth, but the 
		information such as that the spoken text was sarcastic was communicated by their facial 
		expressions. When asked about what happened in the movie, some missed the implied communications 
		and the point of the communications.</p>
		<p>Another example is a gif used in a social media post that communicates a person’s true 
		feelings about a statement they made in text. Some individuals may not be able to understand
		the emotion being demonstrated by the person’s body language or facial expression and miss
		the point the author is trying to make.</p>
		<p>When using body gestures, emotion communications, and facial expressions as the only way 
		to communicate something, it is important to include this in another way to ensure all users 
		understand. One way this can be done is through supplementary text.</p>

          Include vowels, letters or diacritic marks that users need to decipher words. 
		  This is often needed in languages like Arabic and Hebrew.
        </p>
	
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
 		<p>Some languages, such as Hebrew and Arabic, have optional vowels and diacritic marks. 
		Without these marks, many words with the same characters have between two (Hebrew) and 
		seven (Arabic) different ways of being pronounced with different meanings. Most readers 
		can read the word based on the context, and use their visual memory to guess the correct 
		pronunciation. People with impaired visual memory, slow readers and screen readers may 
		often guess the incorrect term and/or pronunciation.</p>

		
		<p>For example a user with a language disability is trying to sound out a word. They guess
		three different pronunciations until they find one that makes sense. Unfortunately, many 
		people with language impairments cannot work out the meaning as words out of context may 
		only provide an idea rather than a specific meaning.  Screenreaders often require these 
		characters to speak the correct word. </p>

		<p>Note that not all diacritic marks are necessary to pronounce the word correctly. Only

      </p>
      <p>
        Many users with learning disabilities cannot remember numbers, such as
        those for their post/zip code, Social Security, or credit card. Many
        users even need to check their phone numbers. This makes entering
        information slow, and they may need to leave their desks or take breaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also many users have short term memory issues that can make copying text
        difficult or impossible. For example, if you can remember 7 letters in
        your head at the same time. They may be able to remember one or two.
        This makes them much more likely to make mistakes copying as it requires
        you to remember the numbers or letter accurately.

      <p>Note that a lot can be achieved through supporting personalization.</p>

        <h3>User testing</h3>
        <p>
          Make sure your user testing includes individuals with a range of
          cognitive disabilities. Do not just ask questions, but ask the user to
          do an action that demonstrates usability.
        </p>
        <p>Test for the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Can the user easily fill in the form without making mistakes?</li>
          <li>
            Was it pleasant to fill out the form? How is their mood changed?
          </li>
          <li>
            Ask the users if they would find this easy to do if under stress or
            tired.
          </li>
          <li>Ask the user if anything was hard.</li>
          <li>
            Ask the user how the form could be easier to fill out. Suggest some
            of the relevant design techniques bellow and ask if it would help
            them with this form.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Pattern: Design forms to prevent mistakes</h3>

        <p>
          Choose a form design that reduces the chance that the user will make a
          mistake. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
		  <li>Design the form so that the user needs to enter as little information as possible;</li>
		  <li>Clearly indicate required fields;</li>
          <li>
            In a text field, accept as many formats as possible. For example
            accept different formats of phone numbers and correct
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#input-errordef"
              >Input errors</a
            >
            automatically;
          </li>
		  <li>Divide long numbers into chunks (support autocomplete across fields);</li>
          <li>Use an interface were only valid input can be selected;</li>
          <li>Use autocomplete and personalization of form controls;</li>
          <li>Accept voice prompts when supported by the operating system;</li>
          <li>
            Automatically correct input errors when possible and the correction is reliable; and
          </li>
          <li>Provide the user with any known suggestions and corrections.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            People with cognitive or learning disabilities and aging users often
            abandon tasks and believe they cannot complete them if they receive
            too many errors. Error messages may be confusing. Correcting errors
            is often difficult and frustrating for users. Many users give up
            when they get successive errors.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, while registering for an online banking account a form
            requires the input of the user's birthdate. The required input
            format is xx/xx/xxxx with a leading zero for single digits. If a
            single input field with no input correction is presented, a user
            with a cognitive disability may enter 1/3/1996 triggering an
            error notification. It may not be clear to the user that the
            required format is 01/03/1996 even if the format is shown below the input field or in the error
            notification.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, a well-designed form makes it easier to fill in the
            information and prevent the user from making mistakes by automatically correcting or suggesting the correct date format. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Minimizing user generated errors by automatically correcting them
            will also minimize error notifications. Error notifications may be
            distracting, taking focus away from tasks and task completion.

        <h3>Pattern: Make it easy to undo errors</h3>
        <p>
          Always allow the user to check their work and correct any mistakes.
          Once the user has fixed their mistake it should be easy to get back to
          the place they were at without redoing additional steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          For financial transactions and important information: Allow the user
          to easily cancel the transactions and provide clear information and
          simple instructions for important information including the amount of
          time the user has to cancel a transaction.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            People with cognitive and learning impairments make many more
            mistakes filling out forms than the general population. When
            mistakes cannot be easily corrected they cannot complete the task.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ability to undo errors helps people with cognitive disabilities safely use forms
            and reduces the consequences that result from a mistake.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user with a memory impairment may not remember that
            they have already added an item to their shopping cart and may add
            the item a second time. They may confuse the dates when booking a
            trip or make other mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is essential that people with cognitive impairments have the
            opportunity to check their work AND fix their mistakes easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            For people with cognitive disabilities, mistakes being theoretically
            reversible is not enough. Often the process of reversing a
            transaction is too complex for them to manage without help. They may
            not have access to that help meaning they have to live with all the
            mistakes they have made. In
            addition, if the process of correcting mistakes is too difficult,
            users may give up, either losing the transaction or buying unwanted
            items.
          </p>
          <p>
            The effect of this happening multiple times is devastating. As a result,
            many users with disabilities may stop using 
            the Internet for many tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allowing the user to change the number of items in the shopping cart
            at any time can significantly reduce mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            A summary of the order, including product quantities and other costs
            before the final submission, gives the user the chance to identify
            any errors and make changes to the order. In this example given, a
            summary of the purchase helps the user see the error in quantity as
            well as a higher than expected order total.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, a user may realize that a mistake has been made after
            the final submission of data. Provide simple language instructions on how to
            cancel transactions and help the user understand the amount of
            time needed to cancel a transaction. This makes them less
            susceptible to scams.
          </p>
          <p>
            In another example, a user with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
            Disorder purchasing a travel ticket on a website may struggle with
            details and may have a low attention span. The successful completion
            of the order relies on the information provided at multiple steps in
            the process. An error due to lack of accuracy or attention to detail
            such as an incorrect street number or zip code in the billing
            address will result in the order not going though. If a summary is
            not provided before submitting the final order, the
            user may not understand the reason for the declined payment and give
            up on the order. The user may also give up if there is not an easy
            way to make a correction.

              clearly labeled actions and get back to the place they were at, in
              one clearly labeled action without unwanted loss of data. (Some

        <h3>Pattern: Use clear labels</h3>
        <p>Use clear labels. Labels should:</p>
			<ul><li>Use common words and plain text,</li> 
			<li>Be visible and next to the relevant control, and </li>
			<li>Be readable by assistive technologies made for people with cognitive disabilities.</li>
			</ul>

        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
			<p>When labels are  missing or unclear, users often do not know that the feature 
			is available or what the control is. Although many users can guess what a control 
			is for users with cognitive disabilities or impaired memory or executive function 
			are less likely to be able to remember  the design pattern or  work out what it is.
			A clear label, next to the control, means people with cognitive disabilities are more 
			likely to be able to use it.
			</p>
			<p>Similarly, if a label is not next to a control it is confusing  for some users.  
			When a label cannot be next to a control, there should be clear visual indicators 
			that clearly, and visibly associate them, so that the control and not belong to a different 
			label. (This will need user testing with learning and cognitive disabilities to ensure it is usable.) 
			</p>
			<p>For example, a user living  with dementia is using an application. Some controls 
			do not have visual labels. A care giver shows them what the control is for and they 
			can use the application. The next day they try and use it again but cannot remember 
			what the control is for. This application is not useable for them.
			</p>
			<p>In another example, the label disappears when the focus is removed. The user cannot 
			remember what the control is and does not know how to make it reappear. 
			</p>
			<p>Labels need to be visible, readable by AT, and be nearby the labeled content</p>

          <h4>More details</h4>
          <p>
            Many people with learning and cognitive disabilities use web extension and simple screenreaders. 
			These assistive technologies often do not read ARIA or titles. Until that changes, or an extension displays them, 
			labels should not rely on these attributes for people with learning or cognitive disabilities.

          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Forgiving form entry processes help prevent user errors up front.
            This reduces frustration and enhances the user’s autonomy and
            independence because they can avoid asking for help. This helps
            anybody with memory issues, people new to culture, and people on the
            autism spectrum who may miss cultural context.

        <h3>Pattern: Avoid data loss and "time outs"</h3>
        <p>
          Avoid timeouts and save users' work as they go. When this is not possible, inform the user of the amount
          of time required to complete the process (before timeout) and if user
          will lose entered data if a timeout occurs.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            The use of timed events can present significant barriers for users
            with cognitive disabilities, as these users may require more time to
            read content or to perform functions, such as completing an online
            form.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the completion of an online process for reserving a hotel
            room and purchasing a plane ticket, a user with a cognitive
            impairment may become overwhelmed with the amount of instruction and
            data input required to complete the process. The user may not be
            able to complete the process in one sitting, and may need to take a
            break. Users should be able to leave a process without losing their
            current place within the process, and without losing data that have
            already been entered. If users cannot take a break and check their
            work, many will often be unable to complete a task correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            While making a purchase on an e-commerce Web site, a user with a
            cognitive disability may not remember required information (e.g., a
            phone number or a zip code) that may seem easy to remember for users
            without a cognitive impairment. Users with cognitive disabilities
            may need additional time to look up the information required to
            complete a transaction, without losing their place in the process,
            and without losing data that have already been entered.
          </p>
          <p>
            In another example, users’ cognitive skills may temporarily diminish
            as they get tired. They then must stop the task for that day, and
            continue it when they are feeling better, and when their reading or
            processing skills are back to their higher levels.
          </p>

          <p>
            This pattern helps people with a variety of disabilities including
            the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              People with physical disabilities, who often need more time to
              react, to type, and to complete activities.</li>
			  <li>People with low
              vision need more time to locate things on screen and to read.</li>
              <li>People who are blind and who use screen readers may need more
              time to understand screen layouts, to find information, and to
              operate controls. </li>
			  <li>People who have cognitive or language
              limitations need more time to read and to understand. </li>
			  <li>People who
              are deaf and who communicate in sign language may need more time
              to read textual information (which may be a second language for
              some).
            </li>
            <li>
              In circumstances where a sign-language interpreter may be relating
              audio content to a user who is deaf, control over time limits is
              also important.
            </li>
            <li>
              People with reading disabilities, cognitive limitations, and
              learning disabilities, who may need more time to read or to
              comprehend information, can pause content to have additional time
              to read it.

          <p>
            For situations where the absence of a timed event would
            significantly change the intended functionality of an application
            (e.g., an auction or another real-time event), it is important to
            ensure that users with disabilities are properly notified.
          </p>
          <p>
            A website only times out when sensitive information is given (such
            as the users credit card information). The sensitive information is
            asked for at the last stage of the process. The user is warned that
            once they give the credit card information they should complete the
            process quickly as the session can time out. After a period of
            inactivity, the Web page asks the user to press any key for more
            time. If the user does not respond within 120 seconds, a timeout
            occurs. However, when the user comes back and logs-in again all the
            content is back.

            <li>
              A website uses a client-side time limit to help protect users who
              may step away from their computers. After a period of inactivity,
              the Web page asks if the user needs more time. If the user does
              not respond within 120 seconds, a timeout occurs. The user is able
              to request more time at least 10 times.
            </li>
            <li>
              A webpage has a section that automatically updates with the
              latest headlines in a rotating fashion. There is an interactive
              control that is easy to activate and is labeled with simple text.
              It allows the user to extend the length of time, between each
              update, to as much as ten times the default. The control can be
              operated by mouse, keyboard, or touch.
            </li>
            <li>
              A ticket-purchasing web site allows users two minutes to confirm
              purchase of selected seats, but warns users when their time is
              almost out. It allows users to extend this time limit at least 10
              times using a simple action, which is labeled with simple text,
              such as a button labeled "Extend time limit."
            </li>
            <li>
              In an auction, there is a time limit on the amount of time a user
              has to submit a bid. Because the time limit applies to all users
              who want to bid on an item, it would be unfair to extend the time
              limit for one user. Therefore, a time limit is required for this
              type of activity. No extension, adjustment, or deactivation of
              such a time limit is required by this design requirement.
            </li>
          <li>
            A Web site with sensitive information uses a client-side time limit
            to help protect users who may step away from their computers. After
            a period of inactivity, the Web page asks if the user needs more
            time. If the user does not respond within 120 seconds, a timeout
            occurs. However, when the user logs in again all the work is back.

        <h3>Pattern: Provide feedback</h3>
        <p>
          For each step in a process let the user know of its status and if it
          was successfully completed.

          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          Making the result of each user action clear helps people with a
          variety of cognitive disabilities:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Understand that their actions were processed (e.g., the click did
              something);
            </li>
            <li>Prevent uncertainty or doubt regarding the outcome; and</li>
            <li>Remember what they just did.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, a user with age-related forgetfulness, may have
            difficulty remembering how the interface worked. So when they press
            the send button that may not feel confident that the form was
            submitted. Feedback, such as a thank you message, will tell them submission occurred and
            make them feel confident in the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            During a multi-step task this feedback (user-action feedback) can
            also assist people with attention or short-term cognitive
            disabilities remember what they are doing. For example, a user with
            early dementia may get distracted and then forget exactly where they
            were in the task. This user-action feedback helps re-orient them.
            It also helps them avoid leaving a task by reminding them that they
            are in a process, and where in the process they currently are.
          </p>
          <p>
            Provide easily-recognizable success or failure feedback with every
            user action. When possible the feedback should use a consistent and
            familiar design patterns. For example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              After a step in a multi-step task is completed, breadcrumbs
              display a tick or a checkmark next to that step's name; and, if
              applicable, the title or the name of the next step is readily
              apparent.
            </li>
            <li>
              After a button is clicked, it should look depressed. (Note that if
              it is a toggle button, the state should also be programmatically
              determinable).
            </li>
            <li>
              After a form is submitted or an email message is sent, feedback
              communicating what just happened, such as "Your application was
              submitted, thank you" or "Your email message was sent" is
              provided.

          Tell the user about all charges at the start of a transaction
          including typical values. Any conditions and terms should also be

          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Users with cognitive disabilities who have trouble with memory,
            attention to detail or reading comprehension may not be aware of
            charges unless they are explicitly noted at the start of a
            transaction task. Terms and conditions can be under a link but
            charges must be clearly displayed and available in plain language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly identifying charges at the start of a sale benefits all
            users. Those with cognitive disabilities will particularly benefit
            because some groups are less likely to have inferred or guessed the
            charges would be included. They may not know to look in other
            locations in the user flow or in another location, for example on
            the homepage, or on a rates page.

            the consequences presented in an orderly form to be able to make an
            informed decision. When charges are not clear, the consent of the
            transaction is unclear.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also can take much longer for users with disabilities to go
            through the process of making a purchase. If a person has spent
            hours making an online purchase, it is much more difficult and
            upsetting to find out that they cannot afford it. They will often
            blame themselves for not understanding the price and may experience
            a loss of confidence. They may stop trusting themselves for
            day-to-day activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a person with Executive Function challenges may be
            trying to order a plane ticket, and not realize that there are extra
            fees not quoted in the original price, such as taxes, international
            fees, baggage fees, etc. They may spend hours booking a holiday only
            to find that they can’t afford it. Alternatively, sometimes they end
            up purchasing something they cannot afford. And even if they have
            completed this process in the past, they are not able to bring their
            experience into future purchases to anticipate the final price. The
            result is the user loses confidence in their ability to
            independently purchase a holiday online, may have incurred a debt
            they are unable to pay, may not attempt again, or only with the help
            of a hired professional (e.g. travel agent or assistant).

        <h3>Pattern: Let users control when the content changes</h3>
        <p>
          Ensure that changes of context, functionality, settings, route and
          orientation are initiated only by user request or an easily available
          mechanism is available to turn off such changes. Also provide an easily available
          mechanism to go to previous context, functionality,
          settings, route and orientation.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Any content, settings or functionality which changes unexpectedly,
            without user initiation can result in significant barriers for users
            with cognitive disabilities. Unexpected changes in any of these
            areas can result in loss of focus, anxiety, or confusion in
            understanding or using a user interface (such as menus, buttons and
            design components). Examples include but are not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Automatic launching of new windows or pop-ups;</li>
            <li>
              Submission of forms through mechanisms other than a button that is
              clearly labeled using simple language to submit the form;
            </li>
            <li>Rerouting automatically by a GPS; and</li>
            <li>Changing the direction of a map in a GPS.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, a user may not have a sense of direction or know their
            left and right. Before using a GPS, they may study the route so that
            they know approximately what they are doing and can augment the
            directions of the GPS with their own context, using the GPS for
            cues. The GPS automatically reroutes them because of a small traffic
            delay. They become completely lost and disoriented and can no
            longer use the application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Letting users control when content changes gives users with cognitive disabilities more control over how
            websites and applications behave. This gives them
            the opportunity to make choices that enable them to use the content
            and complete the task.

            The user can set to change the route if more than a specific amount
            of time is saved. They can add more information such as how many
            extra turns are acceptable for saving 5 minutes. When the GPS finds a new route
            that saves time, the GPS tells the user about the change including how many extra 
			turns were added and how much time will be saved. The GPS asks the user if they 
			want to change the route or if the GPS changed it, the
            user can go back to the original route in one touch or command.

            Checking how safety and security techniques work with a wide range
            of customized profile including aging users and users with learning

            Using known techniques to keep sensitive user information safe.
          </li>
          <li>Helping all users understand any relevant known risks. Explain any know risks in plain and friendly language. 
		  This help them make an informed decision and stay in control. </li>
        </ul>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            It is vital that users stay safe on the Internet. Information which
            suggests a user has Dementia or an intellectual disability allows
            predatory companies and individuals to target that user for scams or
            other risky activity. For example, a predatory company could send
            requests for money, saying “you haven’t made your donation” despite
            the user having made one. Avoid storing information that implies
            this or, if you do store it, provide strong security for that
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users with weak executive functioning are less likely to identify
            risks correctly so clearly identifying potential risks helps the
            user stay safe. Add helpful tips for staying safe while using your
            content and provide help in case of problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            To help identify risks, we suggest holding research and focus groups
            with people with cognitive and learning disabilities and to work
            with people with disabilities to solve potential and existing
            problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, many people who cannot copy and paste passwords or use
            two-step authorization codes ask a caregiver to help them. As
            caregivers are often just temporary employees, this leaves the user
            completely exposed. Making passwords longer or requiring users
            change them regularly increases these unsafe practices and actually
            makes the application less secure for many people. This type of
            design error is common because people with cognitive and learning
            disabilities are left out of the user research and analysis.

        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
 		<p>Most people are familiar with a single set of units that are commonly 
		used for metrics in their location or culture. When presented with metrics 
		in other units they are required to perform a conversion in order to 
		understand the relative magnitude. This will often require using tools such 
		as a calculator or web search engine thus making content less accessible.  
		Provide in line alternatives or an option to switch units that is easily 
		selected, or perhaps based on the user’s location. Common examples are the 
		units used for distance, meters, currency and temperature.</p>
         </section>
		 <section>
          <h4>More details</h4>
          <p>Sometimes metrics are commonly declared in a specific unit even when

      <h2>  
        Objective: Help users to maintain focus
      </h2>
      <p>
        Distractions can cause users with cognitive disabilities problems such
        as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Losing focus on the current action;</li>
        <li>Drawing attention away from the task they are trying to do; and</li>
        <li>Difficulty for some users who don't know how to understand, avoid,
          and/or stop them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once users become distracted, they may find it
        difficult to remember what they were doing.
        Then they can no longer complete their task at all. This is especially
        problematic for users with both low attention and impaired memory, such
        as users with dementia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Items like bread crumbs can help orient the user and help the user
        restore the context when it is lost. Making breadcrumbs clickable can
        also help the user undo mistakes.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>User testing</h3>
        <p>
          Make sure your user testing includes individuals with a range of
          cognitive disabilities. Do not just ask questions, but ask the user to
          complete an action that demonstrates usability.
        </p>
        <p>Identify the different tasks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Can they achieve the activities easily without losing focus?</li>
          <li>
            Distract the user for a minute so that they lose focus. Can they get
            easily back to the task?
          </li>
          <li>
            Ask the users if they would find this easy to do if under stress or
            tired?
          </li>
          <li>
            Ask the user what would help them remember what they are doing such
            as headers or breadcrumbs.
          </li>
          <li>Ask the user if anything was distracting.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>User stories</h3>
        <p>This leads to the following user stories:</p>

        <p>
          As a user who is easily distracted I need less distractions from my
          task.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a user with a poor memory I need easy sign posts about what is on
          the screen, where I am in a process and what I am doing, in case I get
          distracted in the middle of a task.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Pattern: Limit interruptions</h3>
        <p>
          Avoid interruptions. If you cannot avoid them, provide an easy way to
          control interruptions, reminders, and changes in content, unless they are started
          by the user or involve an emergency.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            For people with memory or attention challenges, interruptions can
            make completing a task very difficult or impossible. This can
            include individuals with Dementia, those that have had a stroke or
            brain injury, and those taking medications with side effects
            impacting memory and/or attention. Certain types of interruptions or
            a certain number may cause them to give up, even if the task is very
            important. Interruptions can include sounds, content that visually
            appears or changes (e.g. ads on a page). Interruptions can be as simple as text
            notifications about the presence of new changes while working in a
            shared online document.
          </p>
          <p>
            A site will work best for those with memory or attention challenges
            if they:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Have no interruptions at all,</li>
            <li>
              Have an easy to use pause option so interruptions can be viewed
              later, or
            </li>
            <li>
              Have a setting where users can select which types of interruptions
              they prefer.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Many news websites have a lot of interruptions that can cause
            challenges for people needing to read important information, such as
            school closures due to bad weather. They may encounter breaking news
            text, advertisements, and pop-up windows. For those with difficulty
            focusing and sifting through the school names, or have two or three
            they need to check, these distractions may make the task impossible.
            By letting the user pause these distractions, and ideally

        <h3>Pattern: Avoid too much content</h3>
        <p>
          Provide users with five or less choices on each screen and remove
          unnecessary content. This can be provided via a simplified version
          alternative that is generated in real time from the same code base as
          the main content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Extra links that do not relate to the main purpose of the page should
          be limited to the footer section. Extra choices can also be provided
          using clear and descriptive titles.
        </p>
        <p>
          This can be provided via a simplified version alternative that is

        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Too much text, too many images and too much other content can cause
            cognitive overload, anxiety and loss of focus. Keeping content down
            to a small number of important points reduces the clutter, calms the
            mind and allows for better understanding whilst aiding memory. In
            particular, it helps those with a short attention span who may leave
            the page if it appears complex.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>More details</h4>
          <p>
            Avoiding long paragraphs and non-meaningful imagery ensures those
            with cognitive impairments can concentrate on the important points
            being made.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keeping to a few short bullet points and limiting to one or two
            images related to the main subject areas of a website or service
            allows the user to choose whether to explore the site further.
          </p>

          <p>
            The intent of this Pattern is not to clutter the page with
            unnecessary information but to provide important cues and
            instructions that will benefit people with disabilities. Too much
            information or instruction can be just as much of a hindrance as too
            little. The goal is to make certain that enough information is
            provided for the user to accomplish the task without undue confusion
            or navigation.

        <h3>
          Pattern: Provide information so a user can prepare for and complete a task with estimated effort
        </h3>
        <p>Emphasize the start of important tasks.</p>
		<p>Before a user performs a task consisting of multiple steps, ensure they have an estimate of the 
		amount of effort required to complete the task. This should include:</p>
			<ul><li>The time it might take and</li>
				<li>Details of any resources needed to perform the task.</li> </ul>
		<p>Once the user starts the task, ensure the use clearly understands when the task is still “in-process” and when it has been completed.</p>

		<section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Some users find distractions difficult especially when the distractions cause them to switch focus mid-task and 
			subsequently return where they left off. For example, a web site may have a large arrow pointing the 
			way to the “book here” link. That emphasizes the start of the booking task, and will help users know 
			when they have started the task.
          </p>
          <p>
            Often people need to manage their times of concentration so they can focus without interruptions. 
			Thus, prior advice on the time a task takes, it’s complexity or working memory load enables them to 
			better prepare and complete without unintentional abandonment. Furthermore, the provision of a list 
			of required resources before starting the task along with an indication of the number steps left until 
			completion of the task will help avoid unwitting failures.
		  </p>
		  </section>
		  <section>
          <h4>Getting started</h4>
          <p>
			Provide an estimate of time required and a  list of all required resources at the start of a multi-step 
			task or form. Break the task into steps.
		  </p>
		  </section>
		 <section>
          <h4>Examples</h4>
          <p><strong>Success</strong> example:</p>
          <p>Before the user begins to book an airline ticket, a message is presented “The average time for 
		  booking an airline ticket is 15- 30 minutes. You will need your travel dates, the number of travelers 
		  and each travelers' passport to complete this process.”</p> 
          </p>
          <p><strong>Failure</strong> example:</p>
          <p>Another airline does not notify the user that they need their passport. The process times out when 
		  the user is trying to find their passport number. The user needs to start over or will abandon the booking.</p>

      <h2>Objective: Ensure processes do not rely on memory</h2>
      <p>
        Do not put barriers that stop people with cognitive disabilities from
        using or getting to content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many users have memory issues and/or language issues that can make
        remembering passwords or remembering numbers, while processing words,
        difficult or impossible. That can make transcribing text or remembering
        passwords difficult or impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes security and authentication put a barrier between users and
        the tasks they are doing. For example, requiring remembering and/or
        transcribing passwords often blocks users with cognitive disabilities
        from accessing content or using a service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes developers put a menu barrier between users and the task they
        are doing so users cannot use the content or service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Voice XML enables voice dialog systems and voice browsers. An example
        might be a phone menu system that ask you "dial 1 for internal services,
        dial 2 for external services, dial 9 for billing services." Sometimes
        users need to hold multiple pieces of transitory information in their
        minds, such as a number being presented as an option, while processing
        terms that follow. Many people with impaired short term memory cannot
        hold more than two or three pieces of information in their memory at the same
        time. As a result, they cannot complete this task and cannot get to the place they need
        to be.
      </p>
      <p>When possible, provide easy-to-use options.</p>
      <p>Note that a lot can be achieved through supporting personalization.</p>
      <section>
        <h3>User testing</h3>
        <p>
          Make sure your user testing includes individuals with a range of
          cognitive disabilities. Do not just ask questions, but ask the user to
          complete an action that demonstrates usability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Identify the different activities that the user may want to complete
          on the page:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Can they achieve the activities without asking for help?</li>
          <li>Does the user make errors trying to achieve the activities?</li>
          <li>Does the user find the activities easy to achieve?</li>
          <li>
            Can the user do the same thing later (the password may have been
            forgotten)?
          </li>
          <li>
            Ask users if they would find this easy to do if under stress or
            tired.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ask users were they might have trouble if they are under stress.

        <h3>
          Pattern: Provide a login that does not rely on memory or other cognitive
          skills
        </h3>
        <p>
          Users can login and register without having more cognitive abilities
          then they need to use a simple web page. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Memorizing character strings;</li>
          <li>Performing calculations;</li>
          <li>Coping;</li>
          <li>Answering puzzles;</li>
          <li>Reliably producing gestures; or</li>
          <li>Recognizing characters presented on screen, and then entering them
            into an input field.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Many people with week memory often lose the password and not be able
            to login and use their applications. Their solutions often are only
            sometimes helpful and have security risks:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              They may have to look at or listen to text several times to copy
              or type it into a form field;
            </li>
            <li>
              They may reuse a single password or use a simple-to-remember
              password, which they can remember.
            </li>
            <li>
              If they need to change their password or use a complicated
              password they may store passwords insecurely, such as written on
              pieces of paper which other people can see.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>They may also struggle with other steps of login, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Entering characters in the correct order;</li>
            <li>
              Entering characters correctly on the first try (resulting in being
              locked out).
            </li>
            <li>Finding a PIN;</li>
            <li>Working out puzzles or distorted letters;</li>
          </ul>
		  <p>
              They can also give up after getting frustrated with time-limited
              procedures or presentations of digital security tokens.
            </p>
          <p>
            Without this design requirement, many people cannot use an
            application or content at all. See

            people from using web services that are often critical. Many people
            cannot make doctors’ appointments, etc., by themselves. This may be
            partly responsible for the reduced life expectancy of people with
            learning and cognitive disabilities.

        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>More details</h4>
          <p>There are many ways to meet this design pattern:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use
              <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/"
                >Web Authentication: An API for accessing Public Key
                Credentials</a
              >
              to support inclusive alternatives that do not rely on cognitive
              function;
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide automatic user authentication based upon the use of a trusted
              device (to which the user has already logged in with their own
              identity);
            </li>
            <li>Use biometrics; or</li>
            <li>
              Use a system the user is already logged in to via third-party authentication services
              (e.g., OAuth, Facebook, etc.);
            </li></ul>
			<p>
              Methods of meeting requirements for alternative user
              authentication would include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Clicking a link sent to an email address or a phone number;
                  (Note that this is easy to implement and may be useful for
                  minimal security, such as allowing comments on a blog);
                </li>
                <li>
                  Logging in by using information present in users' personal
                  documentation, such as the total number of a current account
                  balance, with explanation on how to find this information.

          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Many people cannot use voice menu systems and other complex systems.
            This often stops people from completing critical tasks by themselves. Often
            this can include making doctors' appointments, getting health
            insurance, reaching social services, gettig their water turned back on,
            etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            If people cannot manage voice menus by themselves, they have to ask
            someone else to help them. For example, they may delay making a
            doctor’s appointment or other critical task as not to bother their
            helper. This is a huge problem and means people often do not get the
            help they need or get it too late. This may be partly responsible
            for the lower life expectancy of people with learning and cognitive
            disabilities.

          <p>Why can’t people use complex menus?</p>
          <ul><li>
            A good short term memory (several seconds) is essential so that the
            user can remember the number or the term for the menu. Without these
            functions the user is likely to select the wrong number.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many users have a small short term memory. For example, if you can
            remember 7 letters or items in your head at the same time they may
            be able to remember one or two. This makes them less likely to
            manage a menu system correctly.
          </li>
          <li>
            For example, a phone menu system (voice ML system) may have an
            option: "Press 3 for internal services" To use this
            option the user must remember a digit 3 while figuring out if they
            need an internal service. Many people cannot do this. It also
            requires them to press the correct digit.
          </li>
          <li>
            When a lot of irrelevant information is given before the correct
            option, the user may give up. This is especially true if they did not understand
            all the earlier options and information.
          </li></ul>
          <p>
            The 0 digit should be reserved for reaching a person. Consistently
            set the first option for each menu to: "to weight for a person who
            can help you press 0". This can help everyone reach the support they
            need.

          <p>Considerations for Speech Recognition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For speech recognition based systems, an existing ETSI standard
              for voice commands for many European languages exists and should
              be used where possible [ETSI 202 076], keeping in mind that
              expecting people to learn more than a few commands places a burden
              on the user.
            </li>
            <li>
              Natural language understanding systems allow users to state their
              requests in their own words, and can be useful for users who have
              difficulty remembering menu options, or who have difficulty
              mapping the offered menu options to their goals. However, natural
              language interfaces can be difficult to use for users who have
              difficulty producing speech or language. Directed dialog
              (menu-based) fallback or transfer to an agent should be provided.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Follow requirements of legislation</p>
          <p>
            For example, the U.S. Telecommunications Act Section 255
            Accessibility Guidelines [Section255] paragraph 1193.41 Input,
            control, and mechanical functions, clauses (g), (h) and (i) apply to
            cognitive disabilities and require that equipment should be operable
            without time-dependent controls, the ability to speak, and should be
            operable by persons with limited cognitive skills.

            Ensure this pattern is included in important systems that affect health, finance,
            communication, water and government services. Unimportant systems, that do not affect the users' health, safety,
            money or rights should incorporate as much of this pattern as possible.

        <h3>Pattern: Do not rely on users memorizing information</h3>
        <p>
          Each step in a sequential process must contain the information
          necessary to allow a user to proceed. They must rely on memory from
          prior steps. When useful, provide a summary of information from
          previous steps, and a mechanism for traversing the process.
        </p>
        <p>Labels are before the activation mechanism.</p>

        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Often content has barrier which prevent users with learning
            disability from completing a step, and as a result, prevents them
            from achieving whatever they wished to achieve.
          </p>
          <p>
            This often happens in multi-step user-interaction dialogs, such as
            voice-menu systems, but it can happen in any task including online
            shopping or forms.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Some systems assume that all users have a good working memory.
              They present several choices to the user and ask them to select
              one choice, whether by speaking or through a key press. The user
              needs hold multiple pieces of transitory information in the mind.
              For example, many users have a small short term memory. For example,
              a phone menu system (voice ML system) may have an option: "press 3
              for internal services" To use this option the user must remember a
              digit 3 whilst figuring out if they need an internal service. Many
              people cannot do this. It also requires them to press the correct
              digit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reduced executive function may also cause problems. Sometime the
              user needs more time to complete a task. But she can be problems
              also if when the system response is too slow. The user may not
              know whether their input has registered with the system, and
              consequently may press the key or speak again.
            </li>
            <li>
              The use needs may need to compare similar options such as
              "billing", "accounts", "sales" and decide which is the service
              that is best suited to solve the issue at hand. Without strong
              reasoning skills the user is likely to select the wrong menu
              option.
            </li>
            <li>
              Advertisements and additional, unrequested information also
              increase the amount of processing required.
            </li>
            <li>
              The use needs to focus on the different options and select the
              correct one. A person with impaired attention may have not be able
              to focus for a long or multi-level menu. Advertising and
              additional, unrequested information also make it harder to retain
              attention.
            </li>
            <li>
              The user needs to interpret the correct terms and match them to
              their needs within a certain time limit. This involves speech
              perception and language understanding: sounds of language are
              heard, interpreted and understood, within a given time.
            </li>
            <li>
              The user needs to understand the terms used in the menu, even if
              they are not relevant to the service options required.
            </li>
            <li>
              When a lot of irrelevant information is given before the correct
              option the user may give up, especially if they did not understand
              all the earlier options and information.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Allowing the 0 digit to get to a person, or having the first option
            "to weight for a person who can help you press 0" can consistently
            help.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each step in a sequential process must contain the information
            necessary to allow a user to proceed. They must NOT rely on memory
            from prior steps. When useful, provide a summary of information from
            previous steps, and an easy mechanism for traversing the process is
            available.

            Follow best practices in general
            <abbr title="voice user interfaces">VUI</abbr> design
          </p>
          <p>
            Standard best practices in voice user interface apply to users with
            cognitive disabilities, and should be followed. A good reference is
            published by The Association for Voice Interaction Design Wiki
            [AVIxD]. Another good reference is [ETSI ETR 096]. Some examples of
            generally accepted best practices in voice user interface design:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Pauses are important between phrases in order to allow processing
              time of language and options.
            </li>
            <li>
              Options in text should be given before the digit to select, or the
              instruction to select that option. This will mean that the user
              does not need to remember the digit or instruction whilst
              processing the term. For example: The prompt "press 1 for the
              secretary," requires the user to remember the digit 1 while
              interpreting the term "secretary". A better prompt is "for the
              secretary (pause): press 1" or " for the secretary (pause) or for
              more help (pause): press 1"
            </li>
            <li>
              Error recovery should be simple, and take the user to a human
              operator if the error persists. Error responses should not end the
              call or send the user to a more complex menu.
            </li>
            <li>
              Advertisements and other extraneous information should not be read
              as it can confuse the user and can make it harder to retain
              attention.
            </li>
            <li>Terms used should be as simple and jargon-free as possible.</li>
            <li>
              Tapered prompts should be used to increase the level of prompt
              detail when the user does not respond as expected.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            See the AVIxD wiki cited above for additional recommendation and
            detail.
          </p>
          <p><strong>User settings</strong></p>
          <p>
            User-specific settings can be used to customize the voice user
            interface (such as menus, and options), keeping in mind that the
            available mechanisms for invoking user-specific settings are minimal
            in a voice interface (speech or DTMF tones). If it is difficult to
            set user preferences, they won't be used. Setting preferences by
            natural language is the most natural ("slow down!") but is not
            currently very common.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Extra time should be a user setting for both the speed of speech
              and ability for the user to define if they need a slower speech or
              more input time etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Timed text should be adjustable (as with all accessible media).
            </li>
            <li>
              The user should be able to extend or disable time out as a system
              default on their device
            </li>
            <li>
              Error recovery should be simple, and take you to a human operator.
              Error response should not though the user off the line or send
              them to a more complex menu. Preferably they should use a reserved
              digit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Timed text should be adjustable (as with all accessible media).
            </li>
            <li>
              Advertisement and other information should not be read as it can
              confuse the user and can make it harder to retain attention.

            <li>Terms used should be as simple as possible.</li>
            <li>
              Examples and advice should be given on how to build a prompt that
              reduces the cognitive load
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Example 1: Reducing cognitive load: The prompt "press 1 for
                  the secretary," requires the user to remember the digit 1
                  while interpreting the term secretary. It is less good then
                  the prompt "for the secretary (pause): press 1" or " for the
                  secretary (pause) or for more help (pause): press 1"
                </li>
                <li>
                  Example 2: Setting a default for a human operator as the
                  number 0

        <h3>User testing</h3>
        <p>
          Make sure your user testing includes individuals with a range of
          cognitive disabilities. Do not just ask questions, but ask the user to
          complete an action that demonstrates usability.
        </p>
        <p>Test for the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Are enough user groups represented?</li>
          <li>
            For example, a typical project may wish to include: People living
            with early stage dementia, age appropriate forgetfulness,
            intellectual disabilities, different specific learning disabilities
            and communication disorders.
          </li>
          <li>
            Identify the different ways a user may “Report Issues and Problems.”
          </li>
          <li>
            Can the user find a way to submit their feedback without asking for
            help?
          </li>
          <li>
            Can the user submit their feedback at each stage of the process
            including from the home page and any place they may get stuck?
          </li>
          <li>Does the user make errors trying to submit their feedback?</li>
          <li>Does the user find it easy to submit their feedback?</li>
          <li>
            Does the user’s mood deteriorate when submitting feedback? (A sign
            of frustration)
          </li>
          <li>
            Ask the users if they would find this easy to do if under stress or
            tired.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ask the user where they might have trouble if they were under
            stress.
          </li>
          <li>
            Does the user understand the feedback process and are they able to
            complete the task? Use concrete ways to check that the user
            understands. For example: Is the user able to identify if/when they
            will receive a response back? The method a response back may come
            (e.g. email, phone). Where the feedback goes/what happens to the
            feedback?
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure it is simple to use and does not require a lot of
            information that will prevent people from giving feedback.
          </li>
          <li>
            Confirm it is available at different stages in the process and is
            one click away.
          </li>
          <li>
            Confirm that when feedback is given and a process is in place for
            acting on it!

        <ul>
          <li>I want to be able to give feedback easily.</li>
          <li>
            I want to be able to give feedback as soon as I get stuck from any
            part in the process.
          </li>
          <li>
            I want to be able to give feedback in any form that other people
            can. When I try and give feedback and cannot manage I feel excluded
            and think the organization does not care about me.

        <h3>Pattern: Provide help and alternative content for complex information and tasks</h3>
        <p>
          Provide content that helps users understand complex information. </p>
		  <p>This should include redundant information for different user groups such as:</p>
		  <ul>
			  <li>Summaries and step-by-step information</li>
			  <li>Explanation of choices and any disadvantages</li>
			  <li>Tables and charts</li>
			  <li>Symbols familiar to the user</li>
			  <li>Well-structured video content</li>
			  <li>Pictures and informational graphics</li>
			  <li>Alternatives for numeric content</li>
			</ul>
        </p>
		<p>Dedicated help and alternative content should be clearly differentiated from primary content.</p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            The use of complex information, long documents and data in a
            particular format can present significant barriers to users with
            cognitive accessibility needs. Users should be able to understand
            the information and successfully complete described tasks without
            requiring further external assistance as much as possible. If
            content is sufficiently complex to cause barrier, it may be
            inaccessible and then additional supporting help should be provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            The complexity of information may be inherent in the information
            itself, for example the language used, the quantity of information,
            or the subject matter. In this case, it is likely to need careful
            explanation, organization and presentation for all users to be able
            to understand without any mistakes, confusion or need of assistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the presentation mode of information, such as a graph,
            diagram or table, may obscure its meaning through complexity. Here,
            a supporting description and guided interpretation will highlight
            the key features the user needs to understand.
          </p>
          <p>Help may be provided in various forms, for example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Text "asides" providing explanation and help for diagrams.</li>
            <li>A supporting chart or graph to illuminate text content.</li>
			<li>Video clips that show the tasks being completed in steps.</li>
            <li>A supplemental table – as long as it is not itself complex.</li>
            <li>
              Popup on hover explanations of keywords - possibly linked to a
              glossary.
            </li>
            <li>A flow chart of steps in a process.</li>
          </ul>

            <li>
              Charts or graphics are provided where they aid the comprehension
              of complex information. (COGA Techniques 2.7.3)
            </li>
            <li>
              Tables are provided where they aid the comprehension of
              information.

            <li>
              Where an understanding of mathematics is not a primary requirement
              for using this content, use one of the following:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Reinforce numbers with non-numerical concepts, e.g., Very
                  Cold, Cold, Cool, Mild, Warm, Hot, Very Hot
                </li>
                <li>Use COGA semantics to supply non-numerical concepts</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              For content with sections use one of the following:
              <ul>
                <li>Using enable semantics to add symbols to sections</li>
                <li>
                  Adding symbols as an addition to headings, key short sentences
                  and phrases to aid understanding.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, as some people have difficulty remembering symbols,
                  use text with the symbol.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Use clear symbols that can easily be seen and expanded.
                    </li>
                    <li>Use images understood by different users.</li>
                    <li>
                      In left to right languages place the image to the left of
                      the text.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

        <h3>Pattern: Provide help for forms and non-standard controls</h3>
        <p>
          Provide help for any complex forms, particularly when there are
          multiple steps, unusual interactions, non-standard controls and
          required fields that do not support autocomplete. Give examples 
		  that make it easy to understand what to do.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Users often find forms and related tasks to be the most complex
            experience with web sites and can easily become confused, unsure, or
            even completely lost. Providing extra help can make the difference
            between being able to successfully complete a task and giving up.
            This is especially true if any part of the form is complex or
            provides nonstandard interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many standard forms controls provide support automatically. For
            example, many fields can be automatically fill it all in the
            information using autocomplete or personalization semantics. Then
            the user will not make mistakes filling it out.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you require additional fields and nonstandard controls many
            users will have difficulty filling it in. Many users with
            disabilities will get the information incorrect or be unable to work
            out how to complete the task. Often this results in the task being
            completely abandoned. In other cases, the user asks a care giver for
            help to complete the form or work the control. In either case, they
            have not been able to complete the task because of their disability.
          </p>

            for maximum usability and accessibility. They are usually understood
            by users, especially if they are familiar with web interactions.
            However, users are likely to experience difficulties if the standard
            form behavior has been altered or completely new controls are
            provided. Assuming the new behaviors have been carefully designed
            and user tested, users may still require help in order to
            successfully use them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples of forms and controls that are likely to require additional
            help:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              New behaviors like bank sort code fields where there is auto
              tabbing between the 3 boxes as digits are entered;
            </li>
            <li>
              Password fields that require certain character types of characters
              to be entered;
            </li>
            <li>
              Surveys with complex interactions, for example where buttons only
              appear depending on previous answers;
            </li>
            <li>
              Date entry where there could be some ambiguity about the required
              format;
            </li>
            <li>custom controls like date pickers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Help can be provided via various mechanisms, perhaps with an
            accessible help button next to a nonstandard control.

            <li>
              Using a standard mechanism for the platform or technologies exists
              for context sensitive help;

            <li>Using COGA semantics for context sensitive help;</li>
            <li>
              Semantic headings are used to provide a logical structure to a
              form adding both the understanding of the form layout and the
              information required. This will also benefit users of Assistive
              Technology.

        <h3>Pattern: Clearly state the results and disadvantages of actions, options, and selections</h3>
        <p>
          When presenting users with actions and selections, clearly explain the benefits, risks and consequences of each option. This includes any:</p> 
			<ul><li>Changes from what the user asked for,</li>
			<li>Disadvantages from the standard product or offering,</li>
			<li>Features that may be a  risk to the users wellbeing or finances.</li></ul>       
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Clearly stating benefits and consequences of each action and selection option helps individuals avoid mistakes. 
			This is particularly important when the results cannot be easily corrected, lead to safety risks, or may never be known.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, a user of a travel site is booking a trip to Geneva. They see an option at a good time, but this ticket 
			is to a different city. They assume the options give are to the location they asked for. They check the dates and times, 
			but, because they cannot read quickly, do not double check the destination. They are taken to a different location, 
			and as a vulnerable user end up at night without accommodation.
          </p>
          <p>
            In another example, a user sees a laptop for sale at a good price. They do not see the refurbished word in the 
			long description. The laptop is not actually a good price.
          </p>
        </section>
		<section>
		<h4>Getting started</h4>
		<ol><li>Whenever you ask the user to make a selection or take an action, consider whether there are any implied or hidden results that the user should be aware of.</li>
		<li>If so, clearly indicate those results within the UI and confirm the user is aware of them.</li></ol> 
		</section>
        <section>
          <h4>Examples</h4>
          <p><strong>Success</strong> example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When choosing an airline ticket, a customer has to select several price points.  Next to each, there 
			  is a clear description of what is included. The least expensive option does not include a meal or baggage 
			  beyond a small carryon. Once purchased the ticket is nonrefundable. The most expensive option can be 
			  refunded or exchanged and includes a meal, carry-on bag, and 1 piece of checked luggage. 
				If the ticket is to a different destination or other unusual or change that could be a risk  to the user is asked to confirm the change.

            </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Failure</strong> example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Each meal option available for selection from an online menu has a fun name. The meal contents, side items, and ability to customize 
			  each option is not visible until two steps later in the process.  A customer must go several screens down on each item in order to make a decision. 
            </li>

        <h3>Pattern: Provide human help</h3>
        <p>
          Ensure easy access to a human who can provide help and support.
          Support can be on accessibility, technical, process or domain based.
        </p>
        <p>
          Access to human help should never require the user to manage complex
          menu systems such as voice menus with different options.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            In cases where the user gets stuck or confused for any reason,
            contact with a human is usually the most effective and suitable
            solution. Otherwise, the user may abandon the process and be left
            with negative attitude towards the service or supplier.
          </p>
          <p>
            One or more contact mechanisms should be easy to locate and use from
            any page or any step in a process.

          <p>Examples include</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              An option for live chat or video call help. Note: It must be full
              accessible and easy to close new windows that open as part of live
              help functionality;
            </li>
            <li>
              A phone number, ideally with a feature to automatically call via
              an interoperable Voice over IP specification;
            </li>
            <li>A simple site contact form;</li>
            <li>
              An email link using the ‘mailto’ protocol with prefilled “to” and
              “subject” fields. Note will not work on all platforms or depending
              of the user's mail client;
            </li>
            <li>
              Use available standards to get human help for example, using the 0
              digit on voice menu systems;
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It is important that voice communication is easy and this implies
            the person providing help can both be easily understood and is able
            to understand others, allowing for a range of vocal and verbal
            characteristics. Sensitivity to the requirements of people with
            learning cognitive disabilities is also important.

        <h3>Pattern: Provide reminders</h3>
        <p>
          Make it easy for the user to set a reminder for date and time
          sensitive events. Use standard API’s when possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reminders must be set only at the user’s request and the user must be
          able to personalize the reminder method.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            People with cognitive and learning difficulties often have
            challenges managing events and time. In fact, being unable to
            correctly manage events and time without support is a diagnostic
            criterion for some groups of disabilities. This results in missing
            meetings, not submitting a request by a certain date or a form
            within a specified time period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using calendar APIs (or task manager) that allow the user to
            automatically add events and deadlines to their own calendar can
            help in many cases, for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When the user copies information into a calendar they often copy
              the day or time incorrectly.
            </li>
            <li>
              The user is challenged processing and retaining time based
              information.
            </li>
            <li>The user is challenged in sequencing time bound events.</li>
            <li>
              The user's skills decrease when tired to such an extent that they
              have to stop a task. They may wish to reschedule the task.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, a user with a learning disability set a doctor's
            appointment online. Often they copy the detailing incorrectly onto
            their calendar. However, the website gives them an option to add the
            appointment to the calendar and sets a reminder an hour before. The
            user now comes to the correct place at the correct time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The benefit to users with cognitive accessibility needs is that they
            can independently manage appointments, deadlines and schedules. The
            ability to set reminders can reduce the cognitive load associated
            when processing time bound tasks. Time dependent activities may be
            monitored and tracked by the user to ensure that they are completed
            in a timely manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Always give the option to set a reminder at the end of the task so
            that the user does not get interrupted.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is essential not to add unwanted reminders as this makes the
            user's calendar too full. This can even prevent them from being able
            to use their calendar at all. The user is the best person to know
            how many reminders, and which type, will best meet their needs.

            Date and time sensitive events are any event that has to be
            completed by a certain time. The time constraints on such an event
            may be defined by a calendar date and time or by the total elapsed
            time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Variables that could be considered on 'when to supply a reminder'
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Time - at a logical time</li>
            <li>Location - prompted when at an appropriate location</li>
            <li>Context - on computer vs. mobile, on specific site, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This design pattern addresses two broad classes of issues associated
            with this type of information:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If the user perceives the activity to be too complex the user may
              decide to abandon the activity and therefore be excluded from the
              information and/or services derived from the completion of the
              activity.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the activity relies on a number of distinct events being
              carried out sequentially over an extended period of time or if a
              single event must be completed by a specified date and time then
              the likelihood of errors being made during the activity increases,
              particularly for users with cognitive accessibility needs.
              Activities are often missed because the date and time is confused.

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Easy to Use: Feedback information and forms are simple and clear.
            (User testing with different user groups is highly recommended.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Easy to Find: Available from any place where the user may get stuck
          </li>
		  <li>Using a preferred communication method such as a form, email, chat, or phone support</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The option to provide feedback should never require the user to manage
          complex menu systems such as Integrated Voice Menus (IVR) with many
          different options.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Providing an easy way for users to give feedback will help people be
            able to share problems, ask for help, make suggestions and positive
            comments. If users cannot give feedback easily, problems will
            continue to exist without the site owner being aware of the
            problems. It is important to allow users to provide feedback from any point in the process so that people do not get lost when trying to explain why they are stuck.
			Ideas for improvements and positive feedback will also be
            missed.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>More details</h4>
          <p>Make sure the feedback option is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Simple to use;</li>
            <li>Available in all stages of the process;</li>
            <li>
              Has a process in place to respond helpfully to any feedback
              submitted;
            </li>
            <li>Does not make the user provide unnecessary information;</li>
            <li>Does not rely on complex menu systems.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Providing multiple methods for gathering feedback is recommended.
            For example, on a website, consider providing all 4 options for
            feedback including live chat, a phone number, a web form and a
            feedback email address.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that chat bots may not be appropriate for this particular type
            of feedback other than to start the feedback process. These can be
            extremely frustrating if you cannot easily get to the area you are
            trying to reach.

          <h4>Examples</h4>
          <p><strong>Success</strong> examples:</p>

          <ul><li>
            A banking website had a major accessibility problem. This problem
            blocked some customers from paying their bills online. One of these
            customers found a feedback form on the page where they got stuck.
            The customer was able to report the problem. A help desk employee
            reached out to the customer and helped them complete their bill
            payment successfully. That help desk employee also reported the
            accessibility problem to the software team. The software team
            corrected the problem in the next software release. The new design
            was easier for all users and resulted in more customers successfully
            paying their bills on time.
          </li>
          
            <li>
              Web Chat or Web Call - An option to provide feedback using live
              chat or a video call. Note: The live chat or video call feature
              must be fully accessible. Web chat should not be a distraction and
              easy to close. Check usability with user testing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Phone - A feedback phone number, ideally with a feature to
              automatically call via Voice over IP. Make sure there are no
              complex voice menus.
            </li>
            <li>
              Web Form - A simple site contact form with no more than 3 required
              fields
            </li>
            <li>
              Email - An email link using the "mailto" protocol with prefilled
              “to” and “subject” fields. Note will not work on all platforms or
              all mail clients.
            </li>
            <li>
              Interactive Voice Response (IVR) - Provide an automatic option at
              the end of an IVR to give feedback by pressing a specific digit on
              the phone.

      <h2>Objective: Support Adaptation and Personalization</h2>
      <p>
        Personalization can enable us to really meet the individual user’s
        needs. Some users need extra support which we can provide with minimal
        effort from the user via personalization. Personalization allows the
        user to select preferred options from a set of alternatives. Some
        alternatives may be provided by the content author or app developer and
        others may be semi-automated. This can include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Familiar symbols and graphics that the user knows;</li>
        <li>Tool tips;</li>
        <li>
          Language they understand such as literal language or common terms;
        </li>
        <li>
          Less features and options to the optimum number for the individual
          user;
        </li>
        <li>Keyboard short cuts that are familiar to the user;</li>
        <li>Widgets for help.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Personalization also helps with the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sometimes user needs conflict;</li>
        <li>
          Learning new designs, patterns and widgets can be confusing - we want
          to allow users use widgets they already know;
        </li>
        <li>Extra support can be annoying to people who do not need it;</li>
        <li>
          Making content predictable is necessary for accessibility for some
          people but can often be considered boring design for other users;
        </li>
        <li>
          Ability to change levels of complexity and simplify the content is
          important as people skills improve or decrease over time or context.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One use-case we would like to see is providing interoperable symbol set
        codes for non-verbal users. Products for people who are non-vocal often
        use symbols to help users communicate. These symbols are in fact people's
        language. Unfortunately, many of these symbols are both subject to copy
        write and are not interoperable. That means end-users can only use one
        device, and can-not use apps or AT from a different company. An open set
        of references for symbol codes for these symbol sets however, could be
        interoperable. That means the end user could use an open source symbol
        set or buy the symbols and use them across different devices or
        applications. Symbols could still be proprietary but they would also be
        interoperable.

        <h3>User testing</h3>
        <p>
          Make sure your user testing includes individuals with a range of
          cognitive disabilities. Do not just ask questions, but ask the user to
          complete an action that demonstrates usability.
        </p>
        <p>Test to ensure that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Personalized versions of the content are supplied if possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Content modifications match declared user preferences such as less
            content, adding and changing symbols or simplified text;
          </li>
          <li>
            Content variations such as text simplification do not incorrectly
            change the meaning, that content is not lost, and that critical
            paths still work;
          </li>
          <li>
            Forms autofill works correctly with all content versions.

        <h3>Pattern: Enable APIs and extensions</h3>

        <p>Allow supporting APIs and extensions to work with your content.</p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            People with cognitive disabilities are often using add-ons or
            extensions as assistive technology. This includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reading of the long form of acronyms;</li>
            <li>
              Support for text-to-speech with synchronized highlighting of the
              phrase being read;
            </li>
            <li>Content simplification;</li>
            <li>Creating mind maps out of the heading structure;</li>
            <li>
              Support for retaining content that has already been entered;
            </li>
            <li>Password management;</li>
            <li>Spell checking;</li>
            <li>Changing the symbols or the interface.</li>
			<li>Changing numbers from digits to words and words to digits</li> 
			<li>Adding white space between lines, sentences, phrases, and chunks</li>
			<li>Alternative ways to input the content such as speech recognition</li>
			<li>Adding pictures</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If these functions are not supported, the author should provide all
            support all the functions of the add-ons in use as assistive
            technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user with traumatic brain injury has executive
            function and memory impairments impacting their ability to remember
            details such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Internet of Things (IoT) interface</li>
            <li>Their user name and password</li>
            <li>What an acronym stands for</li>
            <li>A phone number</li>
            <li>The meaning of uncommon words</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Supporting the use of an add-on that simplifies content and adds
            help (such as the long form of acronyms, and a popup dictionary)
            enables them to understand most content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Supporting password management tools enables him to successfully
            login and avoid being locked out of secure sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Storing non-sensitive information and auto complete helps them fill
            out a form. This suggests common information, like a person's phone
            number or address. It also helps them avoid making mistakes. It
            eliminates the need for accurately recalling this information from
            memory or having to copy and paste it, which is a task that often
            prevent them from successfully using a form.
          </p>
          <p>
            When overwhelmed by textual content, they have an extension that
            inserts symbols that they are familiar with that helps them find the
            content they need.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, sometimes a web site stops their extensions and API’s from
            working. The result is that the use cannot use this web site.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another example is a person that has a language related disability
            (e.g. Dyslexia) which may cause them to read at a slower rate. They
            often miss objects and information that they did not know they
            needed to read. While high-literacy readers scan text, low-literacy
            users may read the text “word-for-word.” This means they only know
            what is written when they have intentionally read out. This is
            similar to having a narrow field of view and they can be unaware of
            other items not directly in the flow of text that they are reading.
            They may also miss things on the page that help them understand what
            to do. For example, there may be a side bar or call out box which
            helps make decisions about which link to go to that matches their
            particular needs. These readers may select the earlier option they
            encounter, because they may not have noticed (or prioritized)
            reading that side bar content. They also might miss information that
            is essential for successfully completing an interaction.
          </p>

          <p>
            Too many options may add to the complexity of interacting with IoT
            devices. Additional options should be easy to ignore and not require
            a lot of reading to understand that they are additional, as well as
            how to skip them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes IoT interfaces may confuse the user, such as a default
            "reading" on a meter being set to “2” and not “1.” The user would
            then need to reset it to “1.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important in any proposed solution to make operational tasks,
            such as interacting with the IoT, as transparent as possible so that
            users can focus their attention on the functional aspects, such as
            relating to content.

            Support compatibility with assistive technology and standardized
            personalization. The definition of standardized API's is identified
            in the native platform's documentation or in a WCAG technique. This
            is important as the design requirement is not open ended.
          </p>
          <p>
            People with cognitive disabilities are often using add-ons as
            assistive technology. It is essential that add-ons and similar tools
            work. Otherwise, we need to make the author support all the
            functions of the add-ons in use as assistive technology.

            </li>
            <li>Test with an extension that add to the left click.</li>
            <li>
              Test with a toolbar that enables simplification or personalization
              and is designed for people with cognitive disabilities.

        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            A user who has difficulty reading or using Web content can be easily
            overwhelmed with too much information on a web page. They need to
            simplify the page to just the critical information that they need
            and not spend all their energy reading and understanding other
            content and features. This is also true for users who are easily
            distracted.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, an email program has lots of features and formatting
            options when drafting an email. This makes it too complex for a lot
            of people. With personalization the user can have a simple option
            with only send and cancel options. There is a “to” and subject line
            but no cc or bcc options. In this setting there is a clear heading
            (write an email) and they have icons that the user understands.

        <h3>Pattern: Support a personalized and familiar interface</h3>
        <p>Provide users with a way to personalize their interface to make it familiar. </p>
		<p>This can be done by:</p>
		<ol><li>Allowing a rollback to a previous interface that the user is familiar with and knows how to use</li>
		<li>Adding semantics on controls, links and symbols that allows the user to control the experience. For example:
        <ul>
          <li>Html 5 autocomplete on common fields;</li>
          <li>Adding a toolbar that adds personalized images;</li>
          <li>Use attributes in personalization semantics.</li>
		</ul> </li>
		</ol>
        <p>
          Personalization technology is still young and is developing rapidly.
          At the time of publication HTML autocorrect on fields was the best
          supported.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>How it helps</h4>
          <p>
            Personalization changes the interface to meet the needs of the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having familiar terms and symbols is key to many users being able to
            use the web. However, what is familiar for one user may be
            unfamiliar to another requiring them to learn new symbols. Adding
            semantics allow symbols and support to be added by an extension or
            browser that is familiar to the individual user.
          </p>
          <p>
            A stronger example is people using Alternative and Augmentative
            Communication (AAC) systems. AAC systems designed for people who are
            non-verbal often use symbols with or without text.
          </p>
          <p>
            These users usually only learn one symbol set. They cannot easily
            communicate with other symbol users in a written format or may
            struggle to understand different symbols used in different
            applications. Some symbols are subject to copyright and cannot be
            shared across applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            If users' symbols are mapped to the same concepts, then user agents
            can load the symbols that are understandable by the user and they
            user can access the web and other applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other support includes autocomplete and extension that help the user
            fill out forms and understand the content. Many users with memory or
            executive functions impairments could not fill in forms without
            asking someone to help copy over information or check their work.
            Autocomplete, many more users to manage forms by themselves.
