      <p>
        Making websites and applications that are friendly for people with
        cognitive impairments affects every part of design and development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditionally accessibility has been most focused on the interface, and
        making that usable for people with sensory and physical impairments in
        vision, hearing and/or mobility. Some accessibility features will help
        people with cognitive impairments, but often the issues are about
        context, language, usability, and other more general factors that impact
        everyone to some degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document aims to provide guidance on how to make websites and
        applications that are friendly for people with cognitive impairments by
        providing guidance for your designs, and design process.

          Background about people with learning and cognitive disabilities and
          the web
        <a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#background"></a></h3>
        <p>
          People with cognitive and learning disabilities may not be able to
          effectively use web content because of the design and content choices
          of the author. Examples may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            People with impaired short term memory may be unable to recall
            passwords or copy access codes. They may have trouble or be unable
            to remember new symbols and interface paradigms;
          </li>
          <li>
            People with different processing speed capabilities may need
            additional time to understand the design relationships and volume of
            information on screen;
          </li>
          <li>
            People with language related disabilities may need simple clear
            language and instructions. Some may rely on supporting graphics and
            familiar symbols to understand content;
          </li>
          <li>
            People with social and/or communication disabilities may need clear
            literal language and may not understand metaphors or non-literal
            text and symbols;
          </li>
          <li>
            People with dyscalculia may not understand or confuse numerical
            references such as percentages;
          </li>
          <li>
            People who have issues with keeping or regaining focus, may be have
            difficulty completing a simple task if there are lots of
            distractions and interruptions. They may need headers and signposts
            to help them regain the context after their attention has been lost
            (including in multimedia);
          </li>
          <li>
            Many groups will need support to minimize errors and complete their
            task. They will struggle with complex, multi-stage processes such as
            filling out forms or entering data correctly or finding the content
            or feature that they need.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These difficulties may sometimes also be experienced by users in the
          general population due to environmental or situational barriers, such
          as when they are trying to use a website when they are distracted. For
          example working on a mobile device while in an unfamiliar or noisy
          situations can demand place addition cognitive load on all users by
          splitting their attention. However, for users with cognitive and
          learning disabilities, these difficulties are likely to be persistent
          and significant, so that they are unable to access content and abandon
          tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cognitive and learning disabilities include long-term and short-term
          and and sometimes permanent difficulties relating to cognitive
          functions, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>perception, memory and attention;</li>
          <li>learning and orientation;</li>
          <li>visual, verbal and numerical thinking.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These are usually hidden difficulties and may be age related. The
          terminology and definitions used for cognitive disabilities varies
          between countries and users are less likely to have a formal diagnosis
          of a disability than individuals with physical and sensory
          difficulties. Cognitive disabilities may include intellectual
          impairments affecting comprehension alongside written and spoken
          expression. People may also experience a co-occurrence of difficulties
          such as dyspraxia / developmental coordination difficulties and ADHD
          should also be taken into account.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be noted that by addressing barriers to accessibility for
          users with cognitive and learning disabilities, improvements to
          digital technologies can be achieved and there is the potential to
          improve user experience for everyone.

          The amount of effort an organization should expend on making a website
          friendly for people with cognitive impairments will vary. For
          organizations that provide public services, or are national (or
          international) private service providers and already conduct
          user-research, they should:
        </p>
        <p>
          Organizations that conduct user research should include people with
          learning and cognitive disabilities as part of user research such as
          usability-testing. This is particularly important for public service
          providers as well as national and international private service
          providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          All organizations, regardless of user research conducted, should
          review designs and early stage development with the design objectives
          in this document.

        <p>
          Some aspects of making web content and applications friendly for
          people with cognitive impairments are best dealt with as part of the
          overall design process. For most organizations there should be scope
          included for a
          <a href="https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-centered-design.html">user-centered design process</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Key parts of this process for people with cognitive impairments should
          be:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Including the needs of users with cognitive impairments in the
            context of use and requirements;
          </li>
          <li>
            Including people with cognitive impairments in research methods such
            as usability testing.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If people with cognitive impairments are included in the usability
          testing and their feedback is accounted for, you can be sure that the
          website will be easier to use for everyone. (See

        <p>
          Usability testing is the best way to know if your content and
          functionality works for real people with cognitive and learning
          disabilities.
        </p>
        <div>
          <img alt="aspects for providing guidance, include usability, accessibility, reliably testable accessibility and automatically testable accessibility " src="img/guidance_aspect.png" height="486" width="600">
        </div>
        <p>
          Usability is important for everyone. If web content and applications are
          difficult to use, they cannot be accessible for people with cognitive
          disabilities. Automated testing for accessibility focuses on more
          technical areas of accessibility, and cannot assess ease of use. It is
          vital for people with cognitive disabilities that development teams do
          not rely solely on automated accessibility testing, but incorporate
          Design Patterns as described in the Appendix, and if possible test with
          people who have cognitive disabilities.
        </p>

          Finding people to include in usability testing who have different
          learning and cognitive disabilities can be relatively easy, such as
          friends, colleagues, relatives or neighbors who:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Are older and struggle to use computers, or have age-related
            forgetfulness;
          </li>
          <li>
            Are at an early stage of dementia
          </li>
          <li>
            Have dyslexia, dyscalculia or ADHD
          </li>
          <li>
            Have a learning or intellectual disability
          </li>
          <li>
            People with acquired cognitive issues (for example, due to
            neurological trauma) who have the same challenges as people with other
            disabilities such as:
            <ul>
              <li>
                having difficulty (asking a family member to help) with booking
                travel booking or hotel booking online
              </li>
              <li>being unable to use online banking</li>
              <li>
                coping with content forms and pop up windows when errors occur
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <p>
            There are some differences when testing for accessibility, and that
            includes when testing with people who have cognitive impairments:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Ensure that the participation forms are easy to understand, send
                them to the participant in advance, and allow plenty of time for
                the participant to ask questions and fill in forms;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Allow the participant to bring a carer, family member or friend to
                attend with them. If your tester has a guardian you should get
                informed consent from both the tester and their guardian;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                It helps to provide easy methods of assessing mood, rather than
                asking for the participant to verbalize, try asking them to select
                a smiley face, such as:<br>
                </p><figure id="fig-a-simple-mood-selector">
                  <img src="img/faces-happy-to-sad.png" width="200" alt="a set of 5 smiley faces from happy, through neutral, to sad.">
                  <figcaption>Figure <bdi class="figno">1</bdi> <span class="fig-title">A simple mood selector</span></figcaption>
                </figure>
              <p></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Ensure the person does not feel like they are at fault for making
                mistakes. While this is always important during usability testing,
                this scenario is even more likely for people with cognitive
                impairments.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some brief guidance on usability testing:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Can your users ( people with learning and cognitive disabilities)
              manage each task reasonably easily and fast. You can time the task
              taken to complete, and note any parts that where the users are
              slowed down or seem to struggle. Also note any errors that they
              making including clicking on the wrong thing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Is completing the task frustrating or upsetting?
              <ol>
                <li>
                  You can ask the users how they are feeling before and after the
                  tasks (or rate their mode such as selecting the smiley which
                  represents how they feel, such as:
                </li>
                <li>ask them if anything was annoying.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                How can you make it better for your users ( people with learning
                and cognitive disabilities)
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>You can analyze the data collected above</li>
                <li>
                  ask them how they feel about the system and if anything was
                  annoying.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                If the user if failing blame the designer and not the user. Such
                as “ it is so helpful that you are doing this because our
                designers are not very good, or are always playing computer games
                so they think everyone is good at this stuff” or “you are really
                helping us make this useable by real people and not just
                engineers” . Stop the process if users are getting distressed
                despite this.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            As a short overview, usability could be measured based on efficacy,
            efficiency and satisfaction. This can be done by measuring or
            tracking:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>successes and noting any errors to measure efficacy,</li>
            <li>
              time taken per task to measure efficiency, note that the relative
              time between tasks is often more useful than absolute numbers. and
            </li>
            <li>user’s mood and comments to measure satisfaction.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>At the end of the evaluation you should be able to answer:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What prevents the user from completing a task?</li>
            <li>
              What creates confusion? When and why do they misinterpret the
              interface?
            </li>
            <li>What produces an error and an incorrect action?</li>
            <li>When does the user get frustrated or upset</li>
            <li>
              When does the user misunderstand navigation, menus and controls?
            </li>
            <li>How can these problems be avoided?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Note you will need to get informed consent from the tester before
            testing. Explain what they will be doing and why it is helping you. If
            there are any risks they need to be explained and understood. If your
            tester has a guardian you should get informed consent from both the
            tester and their guardian. Make sure potential participants are aware
            they can withdraw from the testing situation at any time and that
            their comments will be anonymised before being used in any report.

          Any time there is a 'target audience', there will be people with with
          learning and cognitive disabilities in that audience. Cognitive
          impairments are often invisible in day-to-day life until people
          encounter particular challenges. To provide some context and
          understanding, eight personas have been created which outline fictional
          people with various cognitive impairments and the challenges they face.

          <p>Anna has been a student for the past year. Her Fashion Design course has been challenging but fun. She loves the creative aspect of the diploma and would rather be drawing than writing. She has moderate dyslexia, which affects her ability to read, spell and use numbers. Anna has a poor working memory, especially for numbers and digits. She also has poor auditory discrimination which affects her ability to read quickly.</p>
          <p>Anna had several projects to complete as part of her portfolio, but the one that worried her most involved a written assignment where she has to research the topic of Post-war fashions and their impact on today’s designs.

            <p>Anna's use of the library catalogue from home failed at the first attempt when she could not remember her password. She kept putting in ‘afib61’ rather than ‘afid16’ and could not see the mistake. The error message on the web page had not helped because it announced that her user name or password were incorrect and she was not sure which one was wrong. Luckily, as she was on her own laptop the browser settings allowed her to save her password and she was able to automatically log in.</p>

            <p>Having navigated the online library system, Anna eventually found a paper on the subject she wanted, which she could download in pdf format. She was hoping to use her text-to-speech app to read the content aloud but when she tried to highlight the text nothing happened. She discovered the document was actually an image and yet there was no warning this was the case. She could not find an alternative accessible version of the paper. This meant she had to use optical character recognition to virtually scan the paper. It was not totally successful leaving gaps in the information she found and the process took away valuable time from her writing.</p>

            <p>Finally, Anna found an ejournal that had another article, but there was a form that had to be completed. Anna duly started the process but realized she did not know the author’s name. She returned to the page where she had found the article to copy and paste the name. Sadly when she returned to the form all that she had filled in was lost. She had hoped to just be able to add the final bit, not have to retype the whole thing again. </p>

            <p>Anna is a very slow reader and often sounds out words. She has low auditory processing skills so she cannot speed up her screen reader. Therefore, to manage her busy life she has to try and scan read and skip through the massive amounts of content, emails and newsletter she sees so she can read only the most important parts. Sometimes however, she cannot find important content because it is buried inside lots of other content, or the headers and visual layout of the content does not guide her to where she needs to be. </p>
            
            <p>Anna is always worried that she is missing something important and sometimes she is. For example, her daughters elementary school published a weekly newsletter with interesting stories about activities and important announcements. It contained information that her daughters school was ending early one day, but it was buried under less important information about the school activities. Because it takes her so long to read each word she did not manage to read the whole newsletter and did not know that her daughter was coming home earlier than usual. As a result she was not home in time and her daughter was left waiting outside for over an hour. </p>

            <p>Anna has bad eye hand coordination, so precise movements are hard and she often touches the wrong button or digit when typing on her small phone screen. With her low letter recognition this makes typing in codes or text very unreliable. She also confuses left and right so she is often pressing the off button in place of the volume. In most interactions on her phone she makes some form of mistake, such as loading a new video when she intended to expand the screen of the window she was watching. To use an application successfully it needs to have a consistent back or undo function.</p>

            <p>Maria needs to gather specific types of online information for her job. She often has to run through reports about the company on the company’s website. She is only able to easily read the headlines of web pages. The company’s website looks fancy, has a modern user interface and a lot of dynamic elements that change when you hover the mouse over them. For Maria this site is a total nightmare! She finally finds the link to the data she needs as it appears when she happens to hover over a certain menu item with her mouse. The link is positioned in such a bad place that she did not notice it at first. She has found that it really helps if important interactive items are placed in the usual menu areas on a screen and the icons are clearly defined and easily recognizable.</p>

            <p>While ordering business cards (a multi-step process), Maria has difficulty remembering information that she enters into previous screens. On the first step she sees content choices that the process expects her to remember in subsequent screens. Additionally, the prolonged mental stress that she experiences while navigating processes inhibits her brain from producing the cells necessary to form new memories. Processes that require her to remember information from one step to another need to provide her access to any previously provided information that is required to proceed, at the exact point of use that is required, otherwise she will not be able to complete the process. </p>

          <p>Alison has a medical background, working in rehabilitation of physical injuries, but has recently decided to work part-time to take up more hobbies and be with her grandchildren. She wants to try an online course to learn Chinese, in preparation for a special holiday. Alison considers 63 to be the new 36. However, she has difficulty concentrating and finding the word she wants to say. She often makes typos and has to correct sentences when she re-reads them. She becomes easily frustrated as she finds new technical things, like updated design patterns and applications, to be hard to learn and less intuitive than they used to be. Plus, navigation takes longer than in the past. Unfortunately, this includes learning how to use a new interface and this affects the way she works when swapping between her tablet, phone and computer.</p>

              <p>Alison recently took an evening course to learn how to use Windows and MS Word ten years ago and used to feel very comfortable with the interface. After she had to renew her computer she finds all the updates mean that most applications now appear very different. She realizes that links and buttons have changed appearance and often finds she does not know what to press. Sometimes she will press a picture or stylized heading that is not a control and so is not sure if the internet was down, the site is broken or she has made a mistake. Sometimes she touches something accidentally and the focus moves to a different page or application. For example, she recently tried to enlarge some small text and activated a link instead of enlarging it! She misses the days when all links were in blue and underlined.</p>
              
              <p>Alison loses self-confidence when things go wrong. For example selecting an incorrect button or getting an error that she does not understand. She knows to try and press the back button to go back a step, but it does not always work as she thinks it will. She tends to think she cannot cope, so gives up, but with support to adapt the interface to suit her needs she could learn to use the new style.</p>
              
              <p>Her children worked with her to reduce the number of menu items on the application toolbar so she can concentrate on the ones she regularly uses. They helped her change her settings so when searching for items on the web, only a limited number now appear at one time. They also found her a de-cluttering browser extension that takes away many of the advertisements and other items that clutter her social media pages when communicating with her grandchildren.</p>

              <p>When writing letters and messages on her computer, phone and tablet Alison pauses every so often and checks that what she is writing makes sense. She finds it very annoying having to work so slowly, but by using text-to-speech to read out content she has found she can hear her mistakes more easily than she notices them on the screen. She has also discovered that this process can make reading web pages easier and less tiring. However, she often has to go over instructions several times before completing tasks online. She depends on the fact that forms do not time out or have an option to allow her to extend the time to fill in the edit boxes.</p>

              <p>Alison knows her math skills are not as sharp as they used to be. She is worried about making mistakes that will put her financially at risk and she is not sure she should be using her credit card online. Alison wants to feel safe and supported.</p>
              <p>She has found that autocomplete helps filling out forms, but she tends to worry that what has been entered may not be accurate. She has a paper card listing some commonly needed information such as her phone number, address and postcode. She stores secure information in a special folder and she has set up an agreement with the bank to limit spending on her credit card and mobile banking.</p>

              <p>Alison would like to give feedback and tell her bank what changes they could make to their website to make it more usable for her and other mature customers. She struggles to find the feedback form and she has to type in a lot of information to send her suggestions. When she types in her phone number without the area code she receives an error. She tries to fix the error and send the suggestion but the send button becomes disabled so she probably needs to correct something else as well. At this point Alison feels they do not want her feedback and gives up. She now uses the site much less often. She also finds it hard to reach a support person on the phone because of the confusing phone menu system, so drives into the bank instead. She is thinking of changing to her daughters bank, so her daughter can help her.</p>

          <p>Jonathan is a massage therapist with dyscalculia. For Jonathan numbers are a foreign language. He can add simple numbers with his fingers and cope with very basic sums. However, he has particular difficulty with numbers that have a series of zeros and their relationship to each other such as 10, 100, 1000 etc. He finds complex calculations, symbols and mathematical concepts are very problematic.</p>

            <p>Jonathan struggles with the actual value of products, purchasing the correct quantities, for example when buying food at the supermarket and often orders far too much or too little when using online shopping carts. He has found it is much more helpful to have symbols representing the proportional size of items per price or to have a warning when he has ordered an item that might be very large and therefore costly.  He saves shopping lists that have been successful and where the amounts have been correct so that he can re-use the lists on other occasions. His bank has helped by adding restrictions on the amount he can spend whether online or using his mobile phone. This can be annoying, but has stopped him from overdrawing his account.</p>
          
            <h3 id="scenario-2-remembering-pin-numbers-and-passwords">Scenario 2: Remembering pin numbers and passwords<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#scenario4"></a></h3>
            <p>The use of pin numbers and passwords that insist on including a number has always been an issue and most of the time Jonathan uses a secure password application when online. When it comes to the number on the back of his credit card (Card Verification Code) that is always required at the end of a payment exercise, he has to look it up each time, though autofill has helped with completing the rest of the form. Jonathan made sure that what he originally entered and saved in his browser was correct. Too many times he has had to retrace his steps due to typos and not seeing that the entry was incorrect. When he has to return to the form to make corrections, he finds it essential that the corrections needed are clearly highlighted and the instructions provided are helpful. He also feels that it is important that the data he entered previously has not been lost, as the more often he types in numbers etc. the more likely he is to make mistakes.</p>
          
            <h3 id="scenario-3-using-spreadsheets-shared-with-colleagues">Scenario 3: Using spreadsheets shared with colleagues<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#scenario4"></a></h3>
            <p>At work, there are times when Jonathan has to share a spreadsheet with a colleague to ensure that the group’s accounts are in order, suppliers have been correctly invoiced and fees collected. The mass of numbers affects Jonathan’s ability to concentrate on the various areas on the spreadsheet. He has found that it helps to use color coding, increased spacing and larger font sizes in order to pick out the various elements. He uses a tool for recording his hours where he can press start and stop to see how long he has worked without using maths but he is not confident to add hours worked to the spreadsheet himself. He wishes it was integrated into the work spreadsheet. Jonathan will often use the comment feature to add something that he feels his colleague need to check, rather than making the correction to the spreadsheet himself. 
            
            If the document is saved as a PDF or presented in another format, Jonathan insists that it is easy to use with his text-to-speech program which helps him to check how the numbers need to be said and that he can annotate the contents when using his tablet. This is especially important if he is presenting numbers at a meeting.</p>

          <p>Frank retired from his law firm in his early 60s when he found he was forgetting important items that needed to be discussed in his complex caseload. He found that he was forgetting material that he had just read, losing and misplacing objects and having trouble planning or organizing events. Frank is a very intelligent man and that has not changed. You will often find him reading an article about the law. However, he finds he cannot learn new things that rely on remembering new information. This can include new words or symbols. </p>

            <p>Frank noticed that he had trouble with online calendars and booking flights and hotels when he was planning his summer holiday. He could not work out the way the dates had to be entered into the form and made mistakes with the month and day. If only there had been a good example or tooltip. He also found that when he was booking a flight, the table that had the various lists of airports automatically entered the initials, which was very confusing when he was checking that everything was correct. Finally, there was the issue of making sure he booked the right number of nights for his hotel stay. He knew his arrival time at the airport was a day later than when he left, but it would have helped to have had a calendar with colour and clear markings for the days in the week not just numbers.</p>

            <p>Many web pages now have their own graphic icons and ways of indicating actions that need to be completed. Frank was having problems searching for information about a care home that he thought might help him in the future. He could not work out what the various options were when he came to fill out a form for his requirements. There appeared to be a series of small images beside the edit boxes, but the minute he began to write in the form the text explanation disappeared. He wanted the instructions to remain in place above the area where he was writing and for the box to be highlighted when he found he had missed some important sections.</p>
          
            <h3 id="scenario-3-support-when-using-search-engines">Scenario 3: Support when using search engines<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#scenario5"></a></h3>
            <p>Frank likes to surf the web for anything to do with fishing, his favorite hobby. However, he has found that the sheer number of items that appear when he types in a few words very confusing. Ideally he would like the number of search results to be reduced and perhaps have some way of seeing the items categorized in groups so that he can work out which services he needs. In this case it might also be helpful to have icons appearing when the groups are listed, so that he can see articles about fly fishing in one section and sea fishing in another. Blocks of text with more white space around them would also be helpful so that he is not having to cope with such a mass of text.</p>
                
            <h3 id="scenario-4-making-a-doctors-appointment">Scenario 4: Making a doctors appointment<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#scenario5"></a></h3>
            <p>Frank can be independent, but often finds unsuitable designs make him require help. For example, he was trying to make a doctor's appointment. He went to the doctor's website and clicked on “make an appointment”. Then a popup opened asking him for the date. He became distracted by the phone, and when he returned to the screen he was not sure what it was for. So he did not make the appointment. If the popup had had a clear heading he would have been reminded of what he was doing, but without this landmark he was just confused.</p>
            <p>Later Frank tried calling to make an appointment. Unfortunately, the voice system was automated and asked him questions like “press 2 to make an appointment” Frank typically cannot remember the digit - especially while he is processing the options. He usually gets lost in these systems or types the wrong digit. Frank is reluctant to ask for help and as a result he is not getting the health care he needs. </p>
        
            <h3 id="scenario-5-using-the-heating">Scenario 5: Using the heating<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#scenario5"></a></h3>
            <p>Frank recently moved to a smaller apartment that is easier to take care of. However, this means he is not used to the ICT interfaces for the heating and television system. He has tried to turn on the heat, but the menu item for selecting heat or air conditioning is labeled "mode" and he cannot remember or learn new terms. Frank cannot use the whole unit because of this one term. This has caused emergencies such as hypothermia. Frank keeps the heating on at the same temperature and will only change it when his helper comes. </p>
            <p>The TV also has an ICT interface with a lot of symbols that Frank does not know. His helper put an “on/off” sticker next to the button that he can use, but he cannot change the channel or change the volume. </p>
            <p>When his microwave broke he bought a new one with controls that were similar to his old one. Because the controls were familiar, Frank can use the microwave unaided, although he needs help with the TV and heating.</p>

          <p>George enjoys his job and lives semi-independently in a small town, where he can easily find his way around. However, George finds it hard to use search engines and navigate around websites because of the need to work with large blocks of text. He has problems using the online systems at work, and needs help to search for suitable videos or music. </p>

            <p>George used to use <a href="https://www.makaton.org/aboutMakaton/default">Makaton symbols</a> and gestures when at school, but is able to communicate relatively easily now, although reading and writing remains a challenge. Surfing the web is hard when most interactions require text input, but George likes to watch videos, find images and listen to music as well as playing games online. Friends have set up links with recognizable icons on his tablet and this has made it easy to visit his favorite sites. If recognizable symbols or icons could be used in more situations, George feels he would be able to reach more sites independently. There are search engines designed for children and these often use more images, but tend to be too childish for George’s taste.</p>

            <p>George has been told about surfing safely and not giving out personal information. He is very lucky that his family has set up his Facebook and Skype account with various privacy settings. However, George finds the way emojis change or new icons keep appearing on his message systems rather confusing and does not always realize what some of them mean. He has sometimes selected an inappropriate symbol and then receives a rather short message from a friend in return that is upsetting. He finds it hard to explain what might have happened. He knows there have been times when he really can’t choose the right symbol because it is too small and he finds it hard to accurately hit the spot. George is then very worried as he does not know how to unlike or change his symbol choice.  Interacting with emojis and other symbols is much easier for him with easy ways to enlarge these features on touch interfaces and to undo errors.</p>

            <p>Using a mouse is not easy for everyone and double clicking can take time to learn. George has worked hard to improve his mouse skills by playing many onscreen games, but he still finds it hard to move accurately enough to skip ads on videos or to track down the close/exit method offered by some popup windows. Once again friends have come to the rescue and enabled an ad blocker extension for his browser, but this does not always capture all the ads or prevent George selecting the submit rather than a cross or exit button on a pop up. There have been times when George has downloaded malware without any second warning appearing or been unable to reach a site because he cannot find the small cross on a transparent popup window that overlays the main page.</p>
          
            <h3 id="scenario-4-finding-ways-to-read-instructions">Scenario 4: Finding ways to read instructions<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#scenario6"></a></h3>
            <p>George finds it very hard to read instructions unless they use very short and easy to read words. He needs text that has been simplified. The best option for George is when someone has taken the trouble to provide a summary of a paragraph with a well-known symbol,short bullet points and a clear diagram or image of what is required. He finds videos with instructions usually go too quickly and he has to stop them, going back time and time again. Helpful instructions with well broken up sets of phrases using easy to read words can work well and he can go back to them when he has to remember how to do a particular task. </p>

          <p>Amy loves her computer science course and now programs in several languages. She has discovered she can visualize the outcome of her coding and is quick to find any errors even if they have not been highlighted. Documentation writing is less fun and she tends to be rather too concise which means some users do not receive enough help using her applications.</p>

            <p>Being able to code your own websites can make you very critical of others! Amy finds that she often feels quite confused by some social media sites that have dynamically changing content with random messages and advertisements. She either avoids these sites or tends to try to personalize them by clearing away the clutter and choosing to hide sections. Navigation that does not follow a simple route across an entire site really annoys her, as she feels this does not help anyone. She also finds that she is missing important information on sites that have too much information on pages or have no clear and logical structure.</p>

            <p>When a page loads automatically or animations and videos play automatically cause problems for Amy.  Sometimes, the movement can be very distracting and the sounds alarming. She has always found that sudden noises or something happening unintentionally has been a problem. When designing her own applications and websites she makes sure all the controls for animated objects or videos are very visible and do not start until the user has decided they wish to interact or view the object.</p>

            <p>Amy is always concerned about communicating clearly and finds it hard when people ask her to create a design that includes abstract imagery. Images that do not directly represent something make Amy feel uneasy and she tends to ask if there can be some explanatory text in case other users are confused. On the other hand, a figure of speech where someone has written something that is not literal makes her wish that the writer would use easy to read content as it is hard to understand concepts such as, "the wheels of justice turning slowly."</p>

          <p>Tom was involved in a very serious car crash that left him with some physical, sensory and cognitive disabilities having sustained a brain injury. He has returned to work, but often finds communications strained due to difficulties with memory recollection and visual understanding.</p> 
          <p>Tom had to learn how to walk, talk, and basically live life all over again. Medical experts informed him that his greatest chances for recovery would take place within the first 2 years after his injury. After that he may continue to recover, but at a much slower, and incremental rate. His friends and family were amazed by how quickly he regained his ability to speak, and perform his daily life functions. They were perplexed, however, by all of the cognitive difficulties he expressed having, despite his clear ability to articulate and communicate. For example, he often cannot recognize images and faces. He gets disorientated in physical spaces and often gets lost in rooms, as well as buildings, larger places, documents and websites. </p>    
          <p>He has now returned to his old company as a researcher and is back using applications and the Internet throughout his working day.</p>

            <p>Tom has dexterity difficulties so he sometimes uses speech recognition to work through web pages and enter text. He finds this method the least tiring of all the possible input options. Although his speech is slow, he is able to control his computer using speech commands and dictation. It is quite easy to use simple commands to control websites, although there are times when he forgets some of the commands and has to use his cheat sheet. Tom likes the scroll commands that allow him to read slowly down a page without using any other input device and he can often retrace his steps as he has to reread items.  However, there can be problems if the forms on the website are not labeled correctly or if buttons do not have clear names. Tom had help personalizing some aspects of form completion, but if an element is inaccessible via the keyboard, he has to use the mouse grid to interact with that part of the site. This is a slow process and can be frustrating as Tom finds he loses concentration.</p>

            <p>Tom finds there are times when he spells words incorrectly and he appreciates error corrections or a system that accepts mistakes. He also has word finding problems when he is tired and he welcomes search suggestions,as these are ideas that might be related to his search. However, too many results can cause concern and Tom admits he really cannot work his way through very long lists that have not been broken up with headings and categories.</p>
          
            <h3 id="scenario-3-being-confident-that-he-understands-the-content">Scenario 3: Being confident that he understands the content<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#scenario8"></a></h3>
            <p>Tom has difficulty understanding content when it is not explicitly clear, and without any ambiguity whatsoever. He takes a notably longer amount of time to read and process information in order to be certain that he is interpreting it correctly. His interpretation of information is almost always correct, but even the slightest bit of ambiguity, or open interpretation creates sticking points that he must read over and over again, and question every which way until he can assure himself with the confidence that he understands it correctly. Examples and clear step-by-step instructions can help him have the confidence to complete his task. Simple, clear memorable graphics or large indicators of steps in a process can increase Tom’s understanding,confidence and orientation in a process. </p>

            <p>Tom tries to understand the outline of the page and site, so that he does not get lost in the content. Sometimes he dives into the website but then he does not know where he is in the content or task. Clear and consistent headings in a hierarchical structure are needed for Tom to understand the level of importance of content and a clear site structure lets him orientate himself in the site.</p> 
     
            <p>He values simple, clear graphics that relate to the content and break it up. These help him orient as well as understand and remember the content. This includes: Symbols that emphasize the structure and role of the content or an image that accompanies the main text and makes it memorable.</p> 
          
            <h3 id="scenario-5-cognitive-overload">Scenario 5: Cognitive Overload <a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#scenario8"></a></h3>
            <p>Complex presentations of information (images, diagrams, content heavy web pages, etc) overload Tom’s cognitive functioning. This shuts his brain down and prevents him from progressing through processes, navigating, systems, and environments, and understanding the information presented, at both the micro and macro level.</p>  
            <p>Liberal use of white space can decrease the cognitive load where there is a considerable amount of content on one page. </p>

          </div>

          <p>Carolyn found concentrating at school difficult and when she got into college to take a course in business studies life became even more stressful. She knew she could cope with the studies but never seemed to get her work completed on time, found it hard to start a report and even to create a plan for a project. When working with others she always had good ideas but somehow they were never taken up and she became frustrated often failing to keep her feelings in check. Luckily, a tutor suggested she sought help and when a psychologist, mentioned Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) Carolyn was relieved to have a reason for some of the planning and organizational difficulties she was having. She learnt that if she could make use of her constantly active brain and body as well as manage her time better, she could turn her hobby into a very successful Yoga business. </p>

            <p>Carolyn could not really explain her apparent forgetfulness and not being able to focus or complete tasks, but she knew that if she came across a long document or web page with dense text she had to find the key points. If the web page failed to have a clear structure with a content list, well-spaced and highlighted headings she would be lost and lose concentration. Carolyn also said that if she was using her mobile she found advertisements appearing between chunks of text completely upset her focus and she had to stop reading. However, when there was good use of white space, recognizable icons linking to simple bold text clarifying the important points, Carolyn could target these areas and find out what she needed. A clear summary also provided clarity of understanding and Carolyn could remember much of what she had read.</p>

            <p>When setting up a new website for her business, Carolyn found an attractive template with several different ways of being able to show images of her exercises. However, she could not make the carousel of photographs pause, or a banner with her latest news stop scrolling. This really annoyed her as she found both items stopped her concentrating on the real content on the rest of the site. She thought that if it was upsetting her, what about her intended audience! She had to find a friend to add some code that not only added controls, but also stopped the automatic movement giving her website a calmness that she hoped her yoga teaching achieved.</p>
          
            <h3 id="scenario-3-losing-focus-when-completing-tasks">Scenario 3: Losing focus when completing tasks<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#scenario9"></a></h3> 
            <p>Carolyn enjoyed her Yoga teaching, but found that if she was developing some instructional materials for her website, online tools often failed to provide sufficient guidance. Unless there was a clear pathway and a way to return to the place where she was working, she often deleted items by accident or could not make corrections. Saving endless previews with yet more tabs being open in her browser caused anxiety levels to rise. It was not until she found a web app that made each task clear with a submit button, that saved her work in stages, that she was able to cope. Carolyn was able to see sections of her work in the correct order and could then manage the bite size chunks of instruction, rather than have to deal with it all at once. This made it so much easier for her to complete the exercise sheets and she became confident in her use of the application to the extent she was willing to purchase the pro version.</p>
            
            <h3 id="scenario-4-learning-information-from-a-video">Scenario 4: Learning information from a video <a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#scenario9"></a></h3>
            <p>Theoretically, Carolyn likes instructional videos, but in practice she can only concentrate well enough to learn for a few minutes at a time. Then she loses her concentration. She will usually lose focus earlier if there is more than a minute of content that she already knows. When this happens, she misses the information that she needs! Carolyn tries hard but she still cannot focus for more than a few minutes on content that she already knows. Sometimes she watches videos at high speed so that they are less boring for her, but she still loses focus within a few minutes.  When a video is broken down into segments with clear headings, she can jump to the information she needs to learn, and jump forward over segments that she already knows. When she misses information that she needs she can easily jump to the correct location and focus.</p>

          <div class="p-quotes">
            <ul>
              <li><p><span class="p-issue">Problem:</span><span><q>Long sentences are hard, too many strange words and I get lost.</q></span></p></li>

            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>Sam loved his work as a librarian. He had spent his entire life surrounded by books in peaceful places where he could research his love for history. In recent years, he enjoyed using the web to explore how other people around the world saw the history of his own country and the changing views on famous people from the past. Now he was becoming depressed and very frustrated due to a recent stroke. The right side of his body was paralyzed and he had difficulty having conversations with friends and family due to aphasia. To him this meant that some of his words were muddled, his understanding was not always as clear as it had been and worst of all; he could not read as fluently as he had in the past. One handed typing was slow and he found his word finding abilities often failed him.</p>
          <span id="scenario10-btn" class="btn" style="cursor:hand" onclick="isHidden('scenario10')">See more scenarios</span>.
          <span id="scenario10" style="display:none;">
            <h4 id="scenario-1-having-well-spaced-text-with-words-that-are-easy-to-pick-out">Scenario 1: Having well-spaced text with words that are easy to pick out<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#scenario10"></a></h4>  
            <p>Despite all the difficulties that Sam had with his beloved reading, he was determined to improve and found that if a website had no clutter or background imagery he could read the headings. He also found that if there was adequate spacing and the text was not too complex, he could pick words out and with the help of text-to-speech understand the meaning. He did not like the sound of the synthesized speech, because he found it distracting having always read silently. However, over time, he learnt to enlarge the fonts and if the page had left justified text with uneven right edges, he could find his way about by the different shapes of each paragraph. As he became more confident, he began to use some browser tools and was able to increase the line spacing and change the font style on some of his old favorite online historical documents.</p>
            
            <h3 id="scenario-2-using-edit-boxes-where-the-instructions-disappear">Scenario 2: Using edit boxes where the instructions disappear<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#scenario10"></a></h3> 
            <p>Sam had not expected to have to fill in so many online forms in order to receive benefits due to his disability. They caused immense frustration and feelings of self-doubt due to their lack of clarity. Every time he had to fill in an edit box, the instructions disappeared the minute he began to type and he could not remember what was required. He often had to refresh the page and start again to see the label in the box. Sam spent so long on the task that the page would time out. He had to print it out and get help. This was really upsetting as he wanted to be independent and it often reduced him to tears. This was very unlike him, but as the doctor explained, this was linked to his stroke. He also found it very frustrating when a form required a particular way of formatting information with no example as to how to complete the action. Worse still was when the error was not clearly explained, making correction even harder. Dates, postal codes and phone numbers are a particular nightmare.</p>

            <p>The effects of aphasia with acquired dyslexia can be exhausting and confusing but most worrying for Sam was the sense of getting lost on a web page that he thought he knew. He admitted to being nervous when he could not pick out elements in a page that required an interaction. Sometimes he said he did not dare click on a button in case he did something wrong or was sent to somewhere without warning. Sam found this aspect of his web surfing very alarming, as in the past he had been able to navigate with ease. He discovered that the edges of shapes did not appear as clear as they should have been when people use pale greys and he missed links unless expressly highlighted. If a pop-up window suddenly appeared, there were times when he could not close it to return to the page. Small crosses became a nightmare and Sam stressed that the more things happened on a page, the more confused he became. He mentioned the fact that some sites were easier on his tablet as then it all seemed to flow one way and he could just scroll up and down until he felt happy with a decision.</p> 
          
          <h3 id="scenario-4-coping-with-complex-language">Scenario 4: Coping with complex language<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#scenario10"></a></h3>
          <p>When text was written in the passive voice or in an academic manner with long complex words Sam struggled to sometimes understand their meaning even if they were in context. He also found, if he was required to use the same type of language in a form, that he had to copy the words as he could not always spell them and at times he used the wrong word. When he was able to use an app that enabled the text to be read aloud, he could cope if the language was clear and the sentences were kept short. He liked articles that were written in the active tense so he could understand the main ideas straight away. </p>

        <p>
          To help web content providers meet the needs of people with cognitive
          and learning disabilities we have identified the following objectives:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Design so that as many users as possible understand the site and
                know how to use it. </strong>This often involves using things that are clear and familiar to the
              user so that they do not have to learn new symbols, terms or design
              patterns. Personalization and good use of semantics can help make
              the symbols and design as familiar to the user as possible. People
              with cognitive disabilities rely upon predictable behavior in
              digital content. For example, many websites do not follow the
              standard convention for hyperlinks: blue = unvisited; purple =
              visited; and underlined. See the
              <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme1">design guide</a>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Help the user find what they need. </strong>Navigating the
              system should be easy. See the
              <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme2">design guide for navigation</a>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Use clear and understandable content</strong> This includes
              clear text, clear images, speech, and easy to understand video. See
              the
              <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme3">design guide for understandable content.</a>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Prevent the user from making mistakes and make it easy to correct
                mistakes when they do occur.</strong>
              A good design and use of scripts will make errors less likely, but
              when they do occur the user should know how to correct them, without
              having to render other data or start from the beginning. See the
              <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme4">design guide for errors.</a>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Help the user focus and restore context if attention is
                lost.</strong>
              Items like breadcrumbs can help orientate the user and help the user
              restore the context when it is lost. (Making breadcrumbs clickable
              can also help the user undo mistakes.) See the
              <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme5">design guide for focus.</a>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Minimize the cognitive skills required to use the content and
                avoid barriers</strong>
              that stop people with cognitive disabilities from using content,
              such as hard to use security mechanisms. When possible, provide more
              accessible options. See the
              <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme6">design guide for barriers.</a>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Provide help and support.</strong> Graphics, summaries of
              long documents, adding icons to headings and links are all examples
              of extra help and support. See the
              <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme7">design guide for support.</a>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Feedback is usable by everyone.</strong> If users have
              difficulty sending feedback then you will not know if they are able
              to use the content or when they are experiencing problems.
              Therefore, it is essential that all the feedback mechanisms are
              tested by people with cognitive disabilities. See the
              <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme8">design guide for feedback.</a>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Note that most of the design patterns in the guide were originally
          created as recommendations for WCAG, the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/SC_To_Do_list">full list of potential requirements</a>

        Making websites and applications friendly for people with
        cognitive and learning disabilities affects every part of design and development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accessibility has traditionally focused on the making the user interface
        usable for people with sensory and physical impairments in vision,
        hearing and/or mobility. Some accessibility features that help these user groups also help people
        with cognitive impairments. People with
        cognitive and learning disabilities also need improvements to context, language, usability, and other
        more general factors that impact everyone to some degree. As a result,
        they do not fit well into traditional accessibility standards.
		
      </p>
      <p>
        This document provides assistance making websites and
        applications friendly for people with cognitive and learning disabilities by
        providing you with guidance for your designs and design process.
      </p>
      <p>
       This guide is divided into design themes. Each theme includes user stories, testing 
	   methodologies, and design checkpoints. Just understanding the 
	   themes and user stories may help you make your content more accessible to some 
	   users with cognitive and learning disabilities. Please see the section on user 
	   testing for guidance on how to perform COGA user testing.

          Please note this document is not the final draft. We are still working
          on harmonizing the content and the internal consistency of the terms
          and style. The task force also intends to redo the tables to make them
          consistent with the design patterns (such as in 5.1 and 6.1). In
          addition, design patterns 2.8, 2.9, 2.6 and 2.10 2.13 and 5.3 and 5.6
          need to be checked for overlap. In addition, we are exploring the
          addition of these sections:

        Objective: Help users understand what things are and how to use them
      <a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#objective-help-users-understand-what-things-are-and-how-to-use-them"></a></h4>
      <p>
        Not everyone finds learning new things easy, and not everyone can
        remember new designs.  To use a site or application, people need to know what all
        controls and element are on each page and how to use them. Fewer people can use 
		sites and applications that require users to figure out how to use controls or interact with the page. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Many users, including users with mild cognitive impairment or dementia, cannot easily learn new design metaphors or remember things
        they learned. Without these skills, it can be much harder or impossible to find what
        they need, work out what controls do and how to use them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many users can be overwhelmed by too many options or too much
        information. If an individual's reading is slow, then too much
        information without structure and organization will make it difficult or impossible to use
        the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using familiar design patterns, terms and symbols is key to
        helping users who struggle to remember new
        symbols and design. Users need the following to be familiar:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Element location:</strong> Place elements in expected locations. For example,
          people may look for the search on the top right hand corner of a page.
          If it is somewhere else, it will be hard to find.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Symbols:</strong> Use familiar symbols. For example, people may look for a
          question mark for help. If you use a different symbol, fewer people
          will find help.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Text:</strong> Use familiar terms. For example, some people have a limited
          vocabulary. Uncommon terms may cause them difficulty.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Getting help:</strong> Always make it easy to find help.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Personalization can be extremely useful for designers who want to offer
        familiarity and flexibility. Familiarity helps users with cognitive and
        learning disabilities but is often based on the needs of the individual
        user. Personalization allows users to customize their interface, which
        is important as what is familiar for one user may not be familiar to
        another.

        <p>
          Make sure your user testing includes individuals with a range of
          cognitive disabilities. Do not just ask questions, but ask the user to
          complete an action that demonstrates usability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Test for the following but set up the tests so that the user
          demonstrates their knowledge and understanding rather than answers a
          simple question:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Does the user know what the page is about?</li>
          <li>Does the user know what actions they can take on a page?</li>
          <li>
            Does the user know where they are in a website, an application or a
            multi-step process?
          </li>
          <li>Can the user easily find the different sections of content?</li>
          <li>
            Identify the different activities that the user may want to complete
            on the page:
            <ul>
              <li>Can the user achieve the activities without asking for help?</li>
              <li>
                Does the user make errors trying to achieve the activities?
              </li>
              <li>Does the user find them easy to achieve?</li>
            </ul>

            This helps many people, including those with poor memory and
            attention as well as anyone who is easily distracted due to
            age-appropriate forgetfulness and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
            Disorder. 
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, someone with mild dementia is using online shopping.
            They get distracted and then when they look at the screen again they
            have forgotten what they were doing. A clear heading at the top of
            each page shows clearly
            <strong>what the page is about and what they are doing</strong>.
          </p>
		  <p> In another example, a user with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
            Disorder is looking for information in a video. They can tell by the video title that this video is has the information they need.</p>

            Clearly indicating the current location and progress helps a user
            who loses focus or gets distracted reorient to their current
            activity without reading a great deal of content or restarting.
            Providing information about the steps that need to be completed
            ensures that a user who may find a process difficult to complete can
            determine if they can successfully finish.

              someone with a learning disability is not sure if this application
              has too many steps and if they will manage. By seeing they are

        <p>Use a clear and recognizable design for controls. Make it clear what controls are and how to use them.</p>
		
		<p>Use a clear design for controls by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Using a common style on controls (for example: links being
            underlined);
          </li>
          <li>
            Using common design pattern on links and controls (for example:
            clicking on a link takes you to the page);
          </li>
          <li>
            Making all the borders of controls clear other than textual links
            (for example: a help icon has a border);
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensuring items that are not clickable do not look like links or
            controls.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When this is not possible, provide instructions that explain their
          use. Instructions should be on the same page or one click away and
          written in plain language.
        </p>
        <section id="how-it-helps-1">
          <h6 id="x3-2-2-5-1-how-it-helps"><bdi class="secno">3.2.2.5.1 </bdi>How it helps<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#how-it-helps-1"></a></h6>
          <p>
            Using common style and design pattern on controls makes it easier to
            recognize and understand how to use it. Controls are parts of web
            pages that do something, e.g. a link, button, checkbox. The goal of
            these controls is to have someone use them. For example, an older
            user with age appropriate forgetfulness takes longer to learn new
            designs. They go to an ecommerce site has boxes around the headers
            (such as "womens" or "sale") and simple large text for the "add to
            cart" button. They click on the headings and not on the add to cart.
            After a few failures they assume they cannot manage it and leave the
            site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some users have trouble when controls have a different look, color
            or shape than they have used before. For example, when links do not
            have underlines and blue or purple text (even if this appears with
            focus) some users will not know there is a link.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have difficulty with memory, it can be harder to use unique
            controls. It may be slower to find them on the page. And even if
            they work just a little differently than similar ones, some may need
            to relearn how to use them each time they need to use them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using typical controls on the page will help people know how to use
            them. When using more unique controls, include easy to follow
            instructions and make them easy to find. Regardless of how a user
            uses the page (vision, auditory, voice input) it should be easy to
            identify, understand and use the controls.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are designing a new control, make them easy to identify (I
            know they are there), understand (I know what they do), and use (I
            know how to use them). Test with people with different cognitive and
            learning disabilities. Use a simple style or have easy to follow
            instructions that explain their use.

          <p><strong>Success</strong> example:</p>
          <p>
            Links with an underline and/or blue text color (or purple for

            is selected to be the primary link text color, other text on the
            page does not use this.

            Links without an underline or usual blue text color (or purple for
            already visited links), even those that become clear when they
            receive focus are more difficult to use. Some users may not know

          <p>
            Sometimes users are about to press a control and the control moves.  As a result, users with slow hand-eye coordination and
			processing speed may hit the wrong control causing an unwanted action and 
			disorientation.  For example, a user prepares to press a button on a video. The orientation changes to landscape and the control moves. 
			Because the user has slow eye tracking or hand-eye coordination, they end up pressing a link to a new video. 

          </p>
          <p>
            Shifting controls and content also can cause cognitive overload and increase mental fatigue.
			For example, as a user with Traumatic Brain Injury reads content, the content refreshes 
			and an additional article appears above the current content. The article the user is reading moves down. The user becomes disoriented 
			and the application becomes very hard to use or understand.

          <p>
            Controls that affect only one section of a page is confusing. Many users will look again at the content, try and work out what they are supposed to do, and discover the correct controls or scrollbar. However, many people with cognitive or learning disabilities will not be able to work out what they did incorrectly. Others will feel cognitive overload, and will give up as a result. They may assume the application is broken, or that it is just too complicated for them. For all of these users, the application will not be usable.   
          </p>
          <p>
            Having a border or other visual cue around the controls and the relevant page section make it more understandable. If the controls cannot be next to the area they affect, check with user testing that the users with cognitive and learning disabilities find all the page relationships clear and immediately know how to use the controls.
          </p>
          <p>
            This helps people with cognitive disabilities that impact problem solving skills, those that get overwhelmed when presented with a lot of text, and those with difficulties with more complicated tasks. This can include some individuals with early stages of dementia, people who have had a concussion or a stroke, people with intellectual disabilities, and others. Those impacted may not complete tasks, miss key information, and not return to pages that are complicated to use and understand. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Do not have two scroll bars close together. Some users may find it difficult to determine which one to use with a particular section of content. Instead, use clear visual layout and placement of the scroll bars, break the content into two separate pages, or consider removing unnecessary information from the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, consider a user living with dementia trying to work out which scrollbar to use if there are more than one embedded in scrollable regions. When they try the wrong scrollbar, they do not get the effect they desire and their content may seem to disappear. If a website has 2 scrollbars; each operates a different section. When users try the wrong scroll bar, they do not get the effect they desire.

              <strong>Separating Interactive Elements</strong> - Place interactive elements like scroll bars and buttons close to the content they can impact. Also, keep interactive elements further from content to which they do not apply. This makes it easier to identify which elements will impact each section of content.

            <li>
              Examples of clear dividers include high contrast borders or white space. A change in background color can be a clear divider if the contrast is strong enough.

              Sometimes the structure and relationships can be made clear through personalization or user agents and good use of semantics in the code (see WCAG 2.0 SC 1.3.1).

          <p>
            Many users, such as those with mild cognitive impairment or
            dementia, cannot easily learn and remember new design metaphors.
            Without these skills, it can be much harder or impossible to locate
            desired items to interact with, and to know what interactions may
            do. Users can feel lost or overwhelmed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because common design elements are repeated often over a long period
            of use across many sites, users are more likely to recognize the
            interactions needed.

          <p>Common design elements, affordances and patterns include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Links that look like links and buttons look and act like buttons:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  For example, underline links with a standard style throughout

            </li>
            <li>
              Uses common design patterns, such as are documented in the ARIA
              authoring best practices or are used in the most popular sites:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Very common navigation design patterns and common icons;

            <li>
              Create a standard Visual Hierarchy - Place elements where the user

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Putting the search in the top right hand corner in a website;

                <li>
                  The link to the home page is in the top left hand corner;

            search in the upper right, etc. and create an obvious visual

            Those with difficulty understanding how to interact with information
            need to use cues like color, layout and other visual information to
            help them know where to look, what they should do and how they
            should complete that task.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, an older user with age appropriate forgetfulness takes
            a long time to learn new designs. When they come to a site, the
            first page takes time to understand, but then they know what to do
            on the next page. If the next page is different from the first and
            also difficult to learn, they become tired and make more mistakes,
            as they move to a third page the cognitive load becomes too much and
            they cannot complete the task. This pattern helps by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>

              Headings with the same structural level have the same font and

          Add familiar symbols (icons, images and pictographs) to important content such as controls and section headings.

            People who have language comprehension difficulties who may be able
            to mechanically read but not understand the content or those who
            have learning and/or reading difficulties may rely on symbols to
            understand content and navigate to content they need. 
			Symbols also help people who struggle with language and attention to navigate content, including media.
		  </p>
          <p>
            For example, a person with aphasia, has the intellectual ability to
            understand concepts, but struggles with language. They may be
            dependent on the use of symbols to browse pages for information.
          </p>
          <p>
            It can also help the elderly population who can find cluttered pages
            with dense text hard to read on a screen. Clear symbols and images
            that act as signposts to the text content can be very helpful.

          It is easy to understand and use the site hierarchy and the overall menu structure. Sub-menu items are clearly associated with the main menu items under
          which they fall.
		  It is easy to know that sub-menu items are there and how to get to
          them. Users should be able to easily identify:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The site organization,</li>
		  <li>The menu and content structure,</li>
		  <li>That there are sub-menus and, if there are,</li>
          <li>How to reach sub-menu items.</li>		     
        </ul>
        <section id="how-it-helps-7">
          <h6 id="x3-2-3-3-1-how-it-helps"><bdi class="secno">3.2.3.3.1 </bdi>How it helps<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#how-it-helps-7"></a></h6>
         <p>
            Confusion can occur when visual hierarchy of information is not
            immediately apparent to the user. Distinction between levels in
            content hierarchy may be difficult to understand or perceive due to
            minimal type size or type weight differences or color differences
            that are not easily perceived or understood. Furthermore, hierarchy
            solely dependent on small unique design elements may create
            confusion.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a drop down accordion menu of additional sub-menu items
            may not be viewable without understanding it needs to be clicked (or
            ‘rolled over’) as indicated by a small unique design element.
          </p>
          <p>
            When opening a web page for the first time, the sub-menus are
            typically collapsed and their design may make it difficult to even
            know that they are there. Some users with cognitive disabilities may
            not guess that they are present, or after seeing one expand by
            accident, may not generalize that this structure may be present for
            other items in a menu. Making it easy to notice that there are
            sub-menu items ensures the user can use this part of your site. An
            example is a menu without any visual indication that there are
            sub-menu items.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are times where how to open the sub-menu item may not be easy
            for some with cognitive disabilities. If the control to expand a
            menu item relies on a particular gesture or way of rolling over the
            area with a mouse, for example, the end user may not figure out how
            to expand the sub-menu and may abandon the task. An example would be
            a menu that expands only after moving the mouse over a particular
            side of the menu text.

          <p>
            Small design elements that indicate sub-menu items will be presented
            that aren’t always readily apparent or meaningful to the user and
            not universally adopted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples include a chevron (triangle). In different designs it can
            be either left facing right facing, up facing or down facing
            depending on state and the unique design standard affecting
            interpretation of state.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confusion can occur when a right facing chevron can indicate that
            more information will be presented on the current page when clicked
            or it may mean that information is currently being presented, or it
            may indicate that it takes the user to a new page. Consistent and
            general best practices should be used to make it understandable to
            the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, a series of these nested elements on a long page can
            create visual hierarchy confusion if dependent solely on
            interpretation of design elements.

          <p>
            By creating clear layouts, with easy to use controls, users can focus on the task instead of spending time figuring out how to use the controls and information. They easily find key information, and are more likely to return to the page. Clear layout helps people with cognitive and learning  disabilities that  impact problem solving skills, get overwhelmed when presented with a lot of text,  impact problem solving skills, those that and those with difficulties with more complicated tasks
          </p>
          <p>
           Some people with disabilities need a clear layout to help them know how to use the information. When structure and relationships are unclear, users may need to experiment with different layouts and structures until they work out how to use them. However, people with cognitive disabilities may not be able to do so, and may not be able to use the content or application. Those impacted may not complete tasks, miss key information, and not return to pages that are complicated to use and understand.
          </p>
		  
		  <h5 id="a-good-structure">A good structure<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#a-good-structure"></a></h5>
			<p>
			A clear organization of content into pages and sections with obvious purpose allows users to more easily locate relevant sections and to be confident that those they read in detail will match their purposes. Each page or section of content should be organized and marked so that its purpose is obvious. This might be through the use of visual cues, headings or labels or even a pyramid style of writing. Sometimes symbols (with alt text) can be used to make the sections purpose clear. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Content that is not directly relevant to the main purpose of a page should be distinctly separated and programmatically determinable. There should be no need to read all the content in case something important is missed. For example, ads that appear in-line in a section of content are rarely related to the purpose of a section and can be placed in a separate delimited section. 
			</p>

		  <h5 id="visual-cues">Visual cues<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#visual-cues"></a></h5>
			<p>
			People who have difficulty with recognizing or comprehending written language, having difficulties with concentration or memory can find it easier to process graphical cues.
			</p>
			<p>
			Visual of grouping of information is based on the psychological principle of Common Regions. It has been found that the grouping information using a border or color shading makes it easier for people to identify groups, even if the content of the group is not similar.
			</p>
			<img alt="Example of the Common Regions grouping principle. picuture1" src="img/common-region-1.png">
			<img alt="Example of the Common Regions grouping principle. picuture2" src="img/common-region-2.png">
			<p>Figures: Example of the Common Regions grouping principle.</p>
			
			<p>
			These graphical indicators allow people to identify structure and information types without reading text or have problems distinguishing groups of information. Using the graphical indicators consistently to indicate similar types of items aids with navigating content and reduces the cognitive load. Note that symbols are  also helpful visual indicators. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Note that controls that affect only one section of a page can be confusing. Having a border around the controls and the relevant page section is helpful. If the controls cannot be next to the area they affect, check with user testing that the users find all the page relationships clear and immediately know how to use the controls.
			</p>
			<p>
			For multimedia, each section should have a clear and descriptive heading. The user should be able to jump to each section. 
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Example 1:</strong> Chunks of content run into each other with a "flat design". Whereas some users can work out which chunks belong together, many users with cognitive disabilities will find it challenging or impossible. Thus, all the benefits of chunking content are lost.
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Example 2:</strong> An elementary school publishes a weekly newsletter with interesting stories about activities and important announcements. Important announcements include early school dismissal. If the newsletter has a good heading structure, it will be easier for a parent who is a slow reader to find the important announcements about early school dismissal. Without a good heading structure, the important early dismissal information can be easily missed.
			</p>
			
			<p>Examples of how this pattern will help people:</p>
			<ul><li>A person with memory issues may need a clear heading structure to stay focused.</li>
			<li>Someone with an attention disability gets distracted and then needs to pick up where they left off and headings help.</li>
			<li>A slow reader may depend on a heading structure to find important information they need without forcing them to read the whole document.</li>
			<li>A user on the autism spectrum can identify graphical indicators and the use of color for grouping content but struggles with the labels and heading text.</li>
			<li>A user living with dementia is distracted and then cannot remember what they were doing. The visual cues help them re-orientate themselves on the page. </li>
			</ul>

				<ul><li>If pages are dense with content, check that  content is grouped  and you can see what is related.</li>
					<li>Clearly label content categories, and use visual cues and symbols which will be familiar.  This will help recognition and retrieval rather than rely on memory of your site.</li>
					<li>The heading structure should create an outline of the document that could serve as an abstract of the whole document.</li>
					<li>Heading structure  and graphical indicators makes the content easier to scan and find more detailed information that a person needs at a moment.</li>
					<li>It is also important the graphical indicators do not clutter the interface and are used consistently as that can add an additional cognitive load for users to process. Examples of clear dividers include high contrast borders or white space. A change in background color can be a clear divider if the contrast is strong enough.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Examples of common graphical indicators and visual cues include:</p>
				<ul><li>Group summaries of content with images, such as using a card design using colors or white space;</li>
					<li>Flag important information, such as using call out boxes;</li>
					<li>Indicate different types of information, such as placing quotes in speech bubbles.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Graphical indicators should also be programmatically available to enable assistive technologies to interpret the graphical indicators.</p>
				<p>Sometimes the structure and relationships can be made clear through personalization or user agents and good use of semantics in the code (see WCAG 2.0 SC 1.3.1).</p>

		  <p><strong>Succcess </strong> example:</p>
				<p>A site that uses:</p>
				<ul><li>Separated Content With a Card Design and Symbols - White space, borders or call outs are used in addition to headings and symbols to help define sections of content. This organizes the information on the page so it is easier to determine layout and find specific information;</li>
				<li>Separated Interactive Elements - Place interactive elements like scroll bars and buttons close to the content they can impact. Also, keep interactive elements further from content to which they do not apply. This makes it easier to identify which elements will impact each section of content.</li></ul>
				<p>See GOV.UK. for an success example.</p>

          <p>
            Providing shorter logical segments allows a person to find and
            review a specific topic. If that person loses concentration or steps
            away, clear segmentation allows them to easily find their place in
            the material and start again. This is especially important for
            educational style content where review is often necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chunking media also allows for each segment to be given a unique URL
            and so easily referenced and shared.
          </p>
		  <p>Using a clear, logical structure allows users to orient and navigate through the content easily even if they get distracted.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Some videos can be naturally organized into chapters or segments
            </li>

          <p>
            Users who are unfamiliar with the page (or common design patterns)
            rely on prominent visual styling aids to locate important

          <p>
            The amount of page visible before scrolling is dependent on a wide
            range of factors such as physical device size, resolution, pixel
            density and device setup.
          </p>
          <p>
            The size of the visible region will be site specific. Where
            possible, use site statistics to understand what technology users are
            using and keep this in mind when designing the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, an elementary school publishes a weekly newsletter with
            interesting stories about activities and important announcements.
            Important announcements include early school dismissal. If the
            newsletter includes less important information before the early school dismissal,
			a parent who reads slowly may give up before scrolling down to the important information.
			A clear heading structure can help with this by reducing what needs to be read. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In another example, a user is writing a comment, but the send button
            is not visible when the view focuses on the text area. As a result,
            she cannot see how to send her feedback. The company will then not
            receive any feedback from groups who are not able to find the
            feedback button.

          <p>
            Make it easy to find the most important things on the page. Identify
            key content and its placement early in the design process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Space at the top of the document is most likely to be visible to
            users without scrolling. Place key content at the top of the page to give the best experience to the widest range of users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider the most constrained user experience first (e.g., a 240px
            wide mobile phone) and then design upwards from there in order to
            account for the widest range of scenarios.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conducting user testing can identify common use cases and barriers.
            Adopting responsive development practices can improve the
            flexibility of the page to a range of different devices and
            stations.

          <p>
            Having a search capability allows users to find the content they
            need even if they cannot find the content using the site menus
            or other browsing mechanisms. A user can learn how to use search and
            reuse that skill on many sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            User studies have shown the aging population tends to rely on search
            to locate information rather than navigating menus or surfing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Menu systems and most site navigation require the user to
            understand the categories that the content provider has
            created for general use. Users with impaired executive function may
            be unable to identify the correct categories.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, users know the correct category via memory, rather
            than logic. For example, most users remember that the print function
            is often found under the file menu. Users with impaired memory may
            not be able to find these menu items based on recall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users with impaired short term memory or who are easily distracted may

            Search is most useful when it corrects misspellings, finds
            appropriate or related content and provides suggested auto-corrected
            versions of the search terms that the user can choose from.

        <p>Always let the user return to a previous point.</p>
        <p>
          The standard back button is the best way to do this as it is familiar
          to the user. Many users will try the back button first. 
        </p>
        <p>The user should never lose their work if they press back.</p>
        <section id="how-it-helps-12">
          <h6 id="x3-2-3-3-7-1-how-it-helps"><bdi class="secno">3.2.3.3.7.1 </bdi>How it helps<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#how-it-helps-12"></a></h6>
          <p>
            Allowing users to return to a previous point helps prevent mistakes and makes it easy to
            correct mistakes when they happen.
          </p>
          <p>Examples of mistakes include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Touching a control by accident;</li>
            <li>Opening a new link by accident; and</li>
            <li>Closing a window the user intended to keep open.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If a person easily makes mistakes or makes them often, it is
            important that they can go back and make changes without having
            their work or previous choices deleted.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user is watching a video. They try to increase the
            volume but touch a different link instead. A new video now loads.
            The user can press the back button and return to the video they were
            watching before. They now know they can try and increase the volume
            and if they make a mistake, they can easily go back and try again.
          </p>
          <p>
            In another example, the back button did not work as expected, but
            took them somewhere else (such as the home page). When they try to
            change the volume or add a comment they often lose the video they
            were watching and cannot find the way to get back to it. The user now
            feels they cannot use any of the website's features in case they
            lose their main content again. They do not expand the screen, change
            the volume, or leave comments.
          </p>
          <p>
            In forms, each time the user has to re-enter data presents a new
            chance for mistakes to occur. Entering and re-entering data can be
            stressful and tiring from some people with learning and cognitive
            disabilities. This increases the likelihood of mistakes and may make
            it impossible to submit correct data and complete the intended task.
          </p>
          <p>
            For those with anxiety, memory challenges, and difficulty following
            directions, the ability to go back and review information they have
            entered is very important. For example, for some people the task of
            following directions and reviewing their answers works best as two
            separate tasks. Being able to enter information with their focus
            being on following the directions, and later going back to review
            their answers, helps them be more effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the user has an opportunity to go back and review the data they
            entered, even if submitted by mistake, it is easier to correct the
            information.

            This benefits many people including those with language impairments,
            learning disabilities and a poor memory. Using uncommon words can make text and media difficult to understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            People with language impairments often have a reduced vocabulary and
            learning new terms is a very slow, difficult process. For other
            groups, such as people living with dementia, learning new terms is
            not realistic or possible. Using uncommon words, that they do not
            already know, will make the content incomprehensible [unable to be understood] and unusable.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, someone with mild dementia is trying to turn on an ICT
            heating and air conditioning unit. The menu item for selecting heat
            or air conditioning is labeled "mode". The user cannot use the whole
            unit because of this one term. This type of design has caused emergencies such as
            hypothermia.

        <p>
          Use the tense and the voice that is easiest to understand. In English, this
          is usually the present tense and active voice. Speak directly to the
          user, and use the simplest form of verbs.

          <p>
            Using simple tense and voice benefits many people including those with language impairments,
            learning disabilities or a poor memory. For example, more people
            will understand “press the on button” (present tense and active
            voice) then “the on button should be pressed”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Active voice makes it clear who is supposed to take action. For example,
             “It must be done.” (passive voice) does not say who must act.
            “You must do it.” is active voice and clearly states who has the action.

            <li>
              In languages where present tense and active voice do not exist or

          Use a simple sentence structure. Do not use a double negative to

		  and nested clauses can be confusing.

            Simple sentence structure benefits many people including those with language impairments,

            Many people do not understand non-literal content. For example, a

            the content friendlier. However, this confuses the programmer
            who now cannot do her job as needed.

          <p>You can explain any non-literal language by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Adding a simple language term in brackets next to any non-literal text such
              as a metaphors and similes;</li>

          <p>
            For example, a person with a low working memory cannot hold onto
            many pieces of information at the same time. If they need to
            remember what they are doing, divide the steps and track what they
            have done they are much more likely to make mistakes. When
            instructions are clearly separated and laid out, users can follow

            text content makes it easier to read and understand. People with
            poor memory or anyone who is easily distracted will benefit.
            This also helps people with learning disabilities related to
            processing speed or language. Chunking is helpful to anyone who is
            multitasking.

              <strong>Can a long sentence ever be clearer than two short sentences? </strong>Double-check if a long sentence is clearer than two short
              sentences. Do usability testing to see if people with cognitive

            DOTD Issues Winter Weather Travel Advisory for Calgary. With the
            possibility of snow and rain in the forecast throughout the holiday
            weekend, the Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD)
            announced that department staff is prepared to deal with winter
            weather. Maintenance forces will be on standby to apply sand and
            salt over any affected bridges and roadways, to remove fallen trees
            from the roadway, and to close any roads as needed. Interim
            Secretary Jane Doe urges motorists to take the threat of winter
            weather seriously. "In the event of adverse weather conditions, the
            department will strive to maintain access to highways and
            interstates; however, we encourage the motoring public to avoid
            traveling during snow and ice, if at all possible," said Doe. During
            winter weather conditions, the best thing motorists can do is drive
            slowly and carefully, and avoid driving while distracted. Always
            allow for extra driving time, reduce speeds when visibility is low,
            and make sure there is plenty of room between vehicles. Also, look
            out for black ice, which can form on bridges, overpasses, off- ramps
            and in shady spots. As always, DOTD reminds motorists to buckle up
            and refrain from drinking and driving. Citizens can get the latest
            updates on real-time traffic and road conditions by using the
            Traveler Information System simply by dialing ### from their
            telephone and saying the route or region about which they are
            seeking information. Travelers can also access this information by
            visiting the Traveler Information Website. Motorists can also obtain
            information regarding road closures by contacting DOTD’s Customer
            Service Center at (1-###-###-####). The center is open 7:30 a.m.- 5
            p.m. Monday through Friday.

          <p>
            White space (also called negative space or the background color)
            reduces clutter and provides definition to content. This gives the
            viewer a clear overview of a web page. It is used by designers to
            enhance text and the position of objects on a page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using white space aids navigation through a page and helps people
            read it. It can help the user find important elements on a page. For
            those with cognitive impairments, white space has been shown to ease reading
            difficulties and improves understanding of content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Make sure users can also adjust the amount of white space around
            objects and text via a web extension or user setting. This supports
            the ability to identify important elements in the content of a web
            page.

            Allow for the ability to easily adjust white space around objects

            degree that suits the user and does not disrupt the overall
            integrity of a web page.

            For some readers, decoding words, numbers and symbols does not happen 
            automatically and can be demanding on working memory and executive
            functions. If they find content too demanding they are at risk of
            losing its meaning and the overall context of the message that is
            being conveyed. Some users may use assistive technology or
            personalization tools to reduce the cognitive demands of decoding
            content. An example would be text-to-speech that reads aloud content
            allowing for the use of auditory and visual channels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users should not need to decipher letters, numbers, and words becuase of formatting or punctuation errors. 
			They should be able to focus
            on understanding the meaning of the content, especially when they
            are using assistive technology or personalizing content. It is
            important that the content is created with these adaptations in
            mind, to ensure that all users gain the experience you want them to
            achieve. Content creators should ensure that information is provided
            in a way that can be read accurately by assistive technology. It may
            have to be personalized to suit certain users, but this can be
            achieved when all the elements are accessible.

            <strong>Use punctuation correctly</strong> for the language you are
            writing in, as it will affect how the stress and intonation (known
            as prosody) patterns from the text are heard, when converted into
            speech. For example, in English, commas and semicolons will result
            in a short pause in the speech, whereas a hyphen – will generally be
            ignored. Question marks, exclamation marks and speech marks can
            result in changes in intonation, such as a rise in the pitch of the
            voice.

            <strong>Avoid the use of Roman Numerals and unfamiliar symbols</strong>
            in text were possible. These can confuse readers and are likely to
            be read incorrectly by text-to-speech tools. If these symbols are
            necessary then ensure they are marked up correctly, using techniques
            such as MathML and abbreviation expansions to provide additional
            support. Roman Numerals should be presented in upper case if used in
            isolation as they are likely to be read as individual letters

            Be aware that long numbers may be read as single digits or phrased
            as a single number. This is a particular problem for phone numbers
            or zip codes. While it is difficult to control exactly how these
            numbers are read aloud, content creators can help by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Displaying the content of the number and using HTML semantics to
              ensure users and assistive technologies are aware of the number’s
              purpose. In addition, the following recommendations can assist with
              improving text-to-speech rendering:
            </li>
            <li>
              For phone numbers, using the correct layout for the locality of
              the phone number and ensure users can select the whole phone
              number (including area code), so that text-to-speech voices can
              recognize the format and phrase it correctly.
            </li>
            <li>
              For Zip / Postal codes, including state or address information
              close to the number so that speech voices can expand known
              abbreviations (such as state names) and listeners can perceive the
              context.
            </li>
            <li>
              When writing long numbers, considering what separators will be
              familiar to your readers and how it will be read aloud. In
              general, English speaking countries will use commas between
              thousands and a period as the decimal separator whereas German and
              other European countries do the opposite. For example, 1,245 would
              represent one thousand two hundred and forty-five in English, but
              one point two four five in German. Text-to-speech output will
              assume the separators are being used in the format of the language
              of its voice. If this does not match the content, then listeners
              can become easily confused. While replacing thousand separators
              with a space has become a common convention to avoid confusion, it
              leads to difficulties with text-to-speech with long numbers being
              read out in a disjointed fashion. For example, 120 034 943 can be
              read as one hundred and twenty, zero three four, nine hundred and
              forty-three.

          <p>
            Consider how you write dates, because once again the text-to-speech
            will use the format associated with the language of the voice. A
            date such as 04/03/2019 will be read as “April 3rd 2019” by a US
            English voice and “4th of March 2019” by a British English voice.
            Writing out the month in words can avoid confusion.

        <p>
          Provide a brief summary for a long document. Emphasize any important
          keywords to help people understand the purpose and contents of the
          document, and determine if it might contain information they need.  
		  Also, provide a summary of media files so that users can identify the content they need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Summaries should use common words, short sentences and be written in
          an easy to understand style and tense.

          <p>
            Providing an easy-to-understand summary helps many people to quickly
            decide if the document is relevant to them and their current goal.
            A high level outline in a few sentences or bullet
            points is most effective. Abstracts and executive summaries are
            usually much longer and more detailed as they are designed to
            summarize the entire document.
          </p>

            In general headings are used to break the information down into a
            more manageable size and provide structure to the information being
            presented. This particularly benefits users of Assistive Technology.
            The first section should be a text summary of the document. It may
            include links to other sections if appropriate.

          <p>Not all people can understand numbers and numerical concepts.</p>
          <p>
            For example, some people have dyscalculia, a learning disability
            specifically-related to mathematics. People with dyscalculia have
            significant problems with numbers and mathematical concepts, but
            often excel in other intellectual areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user with dyscalculia may have difficulty processing
            temperature data when presented only in a numeric format. However,
            if non-numeric alternatives are provided (cold, warm, hot etc.) then
            they are able to understand the content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Numeracy issues can occur due to a range of disabilities, the most
            severe being the inability to read or understand numbers. Other
            people have challenges with any calculations such as relative sizes
            or times. When reading measurement an individual with cognitive
            impairment may understand the concept of 90cms as a length but find
            it hard to cope with the fact that 0.9m and 900mm are the same
            length.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a train schedule has a long list of relative times that
            they train leaves for different zones on the hour. The user cannot
            calculate when the next train leaves from their location.

          <p>
            Reading a sentence phrase by phrase conveys more meaning than reading individual words. 
			Phrases are also easier to comprehend. The more words an individual can process in one glance, 
			the faster they can read, the easier they can understand what’s written, and the more they stay interested. Most people can take in a whole 
			line of text, or more at once. Fixating on many words at a time is necessary for comprehension for many people. A slow reader may read a sentence slowly using 6 to 9 
			eye fixations, sometimes taking in only a single word (or less) at a time. Adding 
			background noise reduces the number of words readers can fixate on. Removing background noise helps users 
			comprehend more words at the same time.
          </p>
		  
		  <p>Also, automatic word recognition is used typically in tandem with phonetics to achieve full reading comprehension. 
		  For example, approximately 200 words exist in the English language that must be memorized, and automatically recognized, 
		  because they don't fit traditional letter sound patterns, in order to piece together strings of words into sentences. 
		  If a user can't recognize these words in 3 seconds, then the text is harder to understand. Background noise can increase the amount of time it 
		  takes users to recognize words.  </p>

 		<p>Implied content can be difficult for some users because it requires them to:</p>

			<li>Understand the meaning behind what is being implied.</li></ul>
		<p>One example was a research study where people with autism were asked to watch a movie 
		that had a lot of implied communications. They were watching the actors’ mouth, but the 
		information such as that the spoken text was sarcastic was communicated by their facial 
		expressions. When asked about what happened in the movie, some missed the implied communications 
		and the point of the communications.</p>
		<p>Another example is a gif used in a social media post that communicates a person’s true 
		feelings about a statement they made in text. Some individuals may not be able to understand
		the emotion being demonstrated by the person’s body language or facial expression and miss
		the point the author is trying to make.</p>
		<p>When using body gestures, emotion communications, and facial expressions as the only way 
		to communicate something, it is important to include this in another way to ensure all users 
		understand. One way this can be done is through supplementary text.</p>

 		<p>Some languages, such as Hebrew and Arabic, have optional vowels and diacritic marks. 
		Without these marks, many words with the same characters have between two (Hebrew) and 
		seven (Arabic) different ways of being pronounced with different meanings. Most readers 
		can read the word based on the context, and use their visual memory to guess the correct 
		pronunciation. People with impaired visual memory, slow readers and screen readers may 
		often guess the incorrect term and/or pronunciation.</p>

		
		<p>For example a user with a language disability is trying to sound out a word. They guess
		three different pronunciations until they find one that makes sense. Unfortunately, many 
		people with language impairments cannot work out the meaning as words out of context may 
		only provide an idea rather than a specific meaning.  Screenreaders often require these 
		characters to speak the correct word. </p>

		<p>Note that not all diacritic marks are necessary to pronounce the word correctly. Only 
		letters and diacritic marks that are necessary for the unambiguous pronunciation need to be included.</p>

        Objective: Help users avoid mistakes or correct them
      <a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#objective-help-users-avoid-mistakes-or-correct-them"></a></h5>
      <p>
        A good design and use of scripts will make errors less likely, but when
        they do occur the user should know how to correct them easily without
        stress or extra steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Completing forms and similar tasks is often overwhelming for most users
        with cognitive and learning disabilities. This includes relatively minor
        learning disabilities, such as Dyslexia, or attention related
        disabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many users with learning disabilities cannot remember numbers, such as
        those for their post/zip code, Social Security, or credit card. Many
        users even need to check their phone numbers. This makes entering
        information slow, and they may need to leave their desks or take breaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also many users have short term memory issues that can make copying text
        difficult or impossible. For example, if you can remember 7 letters in
        your head at the same time. They may be able to remember one or two.
        This makes them much more likely to make mistakes copying as it requires
        you to remember the numbers or letter accurately.
      </p>
      <p>Note that a lot can be achieved through supporting personalization.</p>

          Make sure your user testing includes individuals with a range of
          cognitive disabilities. Do not just ask questions, but ask the user to
          do an action that demonstrates usability.
        </p>
        <p>Test for the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Can the user easily fill in the form without making mistakes?</li>
          <li>
            Was it pleasant to fill out the form? How is their mood changed?
          </li>
          <li>
            Ask the users if they would find this easy to do if under stress or
            tired.
          </li>
          <li>Ask the user if anything was hard.</li>
          <li>
            Ask the user how the form could be easier to fill out. Suggest some
            of the relevant design techniques bellow and ask if it would help
            them with this form.

          <li>
            As a user who needs to take breaks during tasks, such as completing
            a form, I want to be sure all my work is saved automatically if my
            computer crashes. I do not want to have to start over again, which
            can create a cycle of reentering my data; and making me more tired
            and more likely to make mistakes.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a user with difficulty typing numbers in the right order, I want
            an interface that makes mistakes less likely.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a user who finds entering information stressful, I want to enter

        <p>
          Choose a form design that reduces the chance that the user will make a
          mistake. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
		  <li>Design the form so that the user needs to enter as little information as possible;</li>
		  <li>Clearly indicate required fields;</li>
          <li>
            In a text field, accept as many formats as possible. For example
            accept different formats of phone numbers and correct
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#input-errordef">Input errors</a>
            automatically;
          </li>
		  <li>Divide long numbers into chunks (support autocomplete across fields);</li>
          <li>Use an interface were only valid input can be selected;</li>
          <li>Use autocomplete and personalization of form controls;</li>
          <li>Accept voice prompts when supported by the operating system;</li>
          <li>
            Automatically correct input errors when possible and the correction is reliable; and
          </li>
          <li>Provide the user with any known suggestions and corrections.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <p>
            People with cognitive or learning disabilities and aging users often
            abandon tasks and believe they cannot complete them if they receive
            too many errors. Error messages may be confusing. Correcting errors
            is often difficult and frustrating for users. Many users give up
            when they get successive errors.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, while registering for an online banking account a form
            requires the input of the user's birthdate. The required input
            format is xx/xx/xxxx with a leading zero for single digits. If a
            single input field with no input correction is presented, a user
            with a cognitive disability may enter 1/3/1996 triggering an
            error notification. It may not be clear to the user that the
            required format is 01/03/1996 even if the format is shown below the input field or in the error
            notification.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, a well-designed form makes it easier to fill in the
            information and prevent the user from making mistakes by automatically correcting or suggesting the correct date format. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Minimizing user generated errors by automatically correcting them
            will also minimize error notifications. Error notifications may be
            distracting, taking focus away from tasks and task completion.

              The booking form provides two calendars without clear labels and
              instructions. The form allows the user to select dates without warning as to
              whether they are possible e.g. flight out on June 1st - flight
              return May 30th;

          <p>
            People with cognitive and learning impairments make many more
            mistakes filling out forms than the general population. When
            mistakes cannot be easily corrected they cannot complete the task.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ability to undo errors helps people with cognitive disabilities safely use forms
            and reduces the consequences that result from a mistake.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user with a memory impairment may not remember that
            they have already added an item to their shopping cart and may add
            the item a second time. They may confuse the dates when booking a
            trip or make other mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is essential that people with cognitive impairments have the
            opportunity to check their work AND fix their mistakes easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            For people with cognitive disabilities, mistakes being theoretically
            reversible is not enough. Often the process of reversing a
            transaction is too complex for them to manage without help. They may
            not have access to that help meaning they have to live with all the
            mistakes they have made. In
            addition, if the process of correcting mistakes is too difficult,
            users may give up, either losing the transaction or buying unwanted
            items.
          </p>
          <p>
            The effect of this happening multiple times is devastating. As a result,
            many users with disabilities may stop using 
            the Internet for many tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allowing the user to change the number of items in the shopping cart
            at any time can significantly reduce mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            A summary of the order, including product quantities and other costs
            before the final submission, gives the user the chance to identify
            any errors and make changes to the order. In this example given, a
            summary of the purchase helps the user see the error in quantity as
            well as a higher than expected order total.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, a user may realize that a mistake has been made after
            the final submission of data. Provide simple language instructions on how to
            cancel transactions and help the user understand the amount of
            time needed to cancel a transaction. This makes them less
            susceptible to scams.
          </p>
          <p>
            In another example, a user with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
            Disorder purchasing a travel ticket on a website may struggle with
            details and may have a low attention span. The successful completion
            of the order relies on the information provided at multiple steps in
            the process. An error due to lack of accuracy or attention to detail
            such as an incorrect street number or zip code in the billing
            address will result in the order not going though. If a summary is
            not provided before submitting the final order, the
            user may not understand the reason for the declined payment and give
            up on the order. The user may also give up if there is not an easy
            way to make a correction.

			<p>When labels are  missing or unclear, users often do not know that the feature 
			is available or what the control is. Although many users can guess what a control 
			is for users with cognitive disabilities or impaired memory or executive function 
			are less likely to be able to remember  the design pattern or  work out what it is.
			A clear label, next to the control, means people with cognitive disabilities are more 
			likely to be able to use it.
			</p>
			<p>Similarly, if a label is not next to a control it is confusing  for some users.  
			When a label cannot be next to a control, there should be clear visual indicators 
			that clearly, and visibly associate them, so that the control and not belong to a different 
			label. (This will need user testing with learning and cognitive disabilities to ensure it is usable.) 
			</p>
			<p>For example, a user living  with dementia is using an application. Some controls 
			do not have visual labels. A care giver shows them what the control is for and they 
			can use the application. The next day they try and use it again but cannot remember 
			what the control is for. This application is not useable for them.
			</p>
			<p>In another example, the label disappears when the focus is removed. The user cannot 
			remember what the control is and does not know how to make it reappear. 
			</p>
			<p>Labels need to be visible, readable by AT, and be nearby the labeled content</p>

            The use of timed events can present significant barriers for users
            with cognitive disabilities, as these users may require more time to
            read content or to perform functions, such as completing an online
            form.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the completion of an online process for reserving a hotel
            room and purchasing a plane ticket, a user with a cognitive
            impairment may become overwhelmed with the amount of instruction and
            data input required to complete the process. The user may not be
            able to complete the process in one sitting, and may need to take a
            break. Users should be able to leave a process without losing their
            current place within the process, and without losing data that have
            already been entered. If users cannot take a break and check their
            work, many will often be unable to complete a task correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            While making a purchase on an e-commerce Web site, a user with a
            cognitive disability may not remember required information (e.g., a
            phone number or a zip code) that may seem easy to remember for users
            without a cognitive impairment. Users with cognitive disabilities
            may need additional time to look up the information required to
            complete a transaction, without losing their place in the process,
            and without losing data that have already been entered.
          </p>
          <p>
            In another example, users’ cognitive skills may temporarily diminish
            as they get tired. They then must stop the task for that day, and
            continue it when they are feeling better, and when their reading or
            processing skills are back to their higher levels.
          </p>

          <p>
            This pattern helps people with a variety of disabilities including
            the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              People with physical disabilities, who often need more time to
              react, to type, and to complete activities.</li>
			  <li>People with low
              vision need more time to locate things on screen and to read.</li>
              <li>People who are blind and who use screen readers may need more
              time to understand screen layouts, to find information, and to
              operate controls. </li>
			  <li>People who have cognitive or language
              limitations need more time to read and to understand. </li>
			  <li>People who
              are deaf and who communicate in sign language may need more time
              to read textual information (which may be a second language for
              some).
            </li>
            <li>
              In circumstances where a sign-language interpreter may be relating
              audio content to a user who is deaf, control over time limits is
              also important.
            </li>
            <li>
              People with reading disabilities, cognitive limitations, and
              learning disabilities, who may need more time to read or to
              comprehend information, can pause content to have additional time
              to read it.

            For situations where the absence of a timed event would
            significantly change the intended functionality of an application

            ensure that users with disabilities are properly notified.

            A website only times out when sensitive information is given (such
            as the users credit card information). The sensitive information is
            asked for at the last stage of the process. The user is warned that
            once they give the credit card information they should complete the
            process quickly as the session can time out. After a period of
            inactivity, the Web page asks the user to press any key for more
            time. If the user does not respond within 120 seconds, a timeout
            occurs. However, when the user comes back and logs-in again all the
            content is back.

              A website uses a client-side time limit to help protect users who
              may step away from their computers. After a period of inactivity,
              the Web page asks if the user needs more time. If the user does
              not respond within 120 seconds, a timeout occurs. The user is able

              A webpage has a section that automatically updates with the
              latest headlines in a rotating fashion. There is an interactive
              control that is easy to activate and is labeled with simple text.
              It allows the user to extend the length of time, between each
              update, to as much as ten times the default. The control can be
              operated by mouse, keyboard, or touch.

              A ticket-purchasing web site allows users two minutes to confirm
              purchase of selected seats, but warns users when their time is
              almost out. It allows users to extend this time limit at least 10
              times using a simple action, which is labeled with simple text,
              such as a button labeled "Extend time limit."
            </li>
            <li>
              In an auction, there is a time limit on the amount of time a user
              has to submit a bid. Because the time limit applies to all users
              who want to bid on an item, it would be unfair to extend the time
              limit for one user. Therefore, a time limit is required for this
              type of activity. No extension, adjustment, or deactivation of
              such a time limit is required by this design requirement.

          Making the result of each user action clear helps people with a
          variety of cognitive disabilities:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Understand that their actions were processed (e.g., the click did
              something);
            </li>
            <li>Prevent uncertainty or doubt regarding the outcome; and</li>
            <li>Remember what they just did.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, a user with age-related forgetfulness, may have
            difficulty remembering how the interface worked. So when they press
            the send button that may not feel confident that the form was
            submitted. Feedback, such as a thank you message, will tell them submission occurred and
            make them feel confident in the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            During a multi-step task this feedback (user-action feedback) can
            also assist people with attention or short-term cognitive
            disabilities remember what they are doing. For example, a user with
            early dementia may get distracted and then forget exactly where they
            were in the task. This user-action feedback helps re-orient them.
            It also helps them avoid leaving a task by reminding them that they
            are in a process, and where in the process they currently are.
          </p>
          <p>
            Provide easily-recognizable success or failure feedback with every
            user action. When possible the feedback should use a consistent and
            familiar design patterns. For example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              After a step in a multi-step task is completed, breadcrumbs
              display a tick or a checkmark next to that step's name; and, if
              applicable, the title or the name of the next step is readily
              apparent.
            </li>
            <li>
              After a button is clicked, it should look depressed. (Note that if
              it is a toggle button, the state should also be programmatically
              determinable).
            </li>
            <li>
              After a form is submitted or an email message is sent, feedback
              communicating what just happened, such as "Your application was
              submitted, thank you" or "Your email message was sent" is
              provided.

            The success or failure of every user initiated action is clearly
            indicated to the user by visual, programmatically-determinable,
            rapid feedback in the primary modalities of the content. Audio
            feedback is supported.

          <p><strong>Success</strong> examples:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              WAI-ARIA states are used to provide state feedback for a toggle
              button with an animation showing the state (such as a button was
              pushed).
            </li>
            <li>
              Use ARIA-pressed with a visual or a checkbox is checked/unchecked.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide a confirmation message when an email message is
              successfully sent, or a form is successfully submitted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide visible and programmatically-determinable information to
              indicate a new password satisfies security requirements.
            </li>

          <p><strong>Failure </strong>example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              There is no progress-indicator (e.g., breadcrumbs) to communicate
              completed and current steps in a multi-step process.

          Pattern: Notify users of fees and charges at the start of a task

        <p>
          Tell the user about all charges at the start of a transaction
          including typical values. Any conditions and terms should also be
          available at the start of the transaction in easy language.
        </p>
        <section id="how-it-helps-34">
          <h6 id="x3-2-3-5-10-1-how-it-helps"><bdi class="secno">3.2.3.5.10.1 </bdi>How it helps<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#how-it-helps-34"></a></h6>
          <p>
            Users with cognitive disabilities who have trouble with memory,
            attention to detail or reading comprehension may not be aware of
            charges unless they are explicitly noted at the start of a
            transaction task. Terms and conditions can be under a link but
            charges must be clearly displayed and available in plain language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly identifying charges at the start of a sale benefits all
            users. Those with cognitive disabilities will particularly benefit
            because some groups are less likely to have inferred or guessed the
            charges would be included. They may not know to look in other
            locations in the user flow or in another location, for example on
            the homepage, or on a rates page.
          </p>
          <p>
            People with impaired Executive Function or memory need to have all
            the consequences presented in an orderly form to be able to make an
            informed decision. When charges are not clear, the consent of the
            transaction is unclear.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also can take much longer for users with disabilities to go
            through the process of making a purchase. If a person has spent
            hours making an online purchase, it is much more difficult and
            upsetting to find out that they cannot afford it. They will often
            blame themselves for not understanding the price and may experience
            a loss of confidence. They may stop trusting themselves for
            day-to-day activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a person with Executive Function challenges may be
            trying to order a plane ticket, and not realize that there are extra
            fees not quoted in the original price, such as taxes, international
            fees, baggage fees, etc. They may spend hours booking a holiday only
            to find that they can’t afford it. Alternatively, sometimes they end
            up purchasing something they cannot afford. And even if they have
            completed this process in the past, they are not able to bring their
            experience into future purchases to anticipate the final price. The
            result is the user loses confidence in their ability to
            independently purchase a holiday online, may have incurred a debt
            they are unable to pay, may not attempt again, or only with the help
            of a hired professional (e.g. travel agent or assistant).

          <p><strong>Success</strong> examples:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>There are no surprise charges or conditions.</li>
            <li>
              Users are aware of all charges (including hidden fees) and can

              For items that shipping charges vary, the range of shipping
              charges and the issues that change the rate would be listed, along
              with a link to where more details can be found. For example,
              weight and speed of shipping my impact your shipping fees which
              can be between $4 and $400 depending on location.

          Ensure that changes of context, functionality, settings, route and
          orientation are initiated only by user request or an easily available
          mechanism is available to turn off such changes. Also provide an easily available

          <p>
            Any content, settings or functionality which changes unexpectedly,
            without user initiation can result in significant barriers for users
            with cognitive disabilities. Unexpected changes in any of these
            areas can result in loss of focus, anxiety, or confusion in
            understanding or using a user interface (such as menus, buttons and
            design components). Examples include but are not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Automatic launching of new windows or pop-ups;</li>
            <li>
              Submission of forms through mechanisms other than a button that is
              clearly labeled using simple language to submit the form;
            </li>
            <li>Rerouting automatically by a GPS; and</li>
            <li>Changing the direction of a map in a GPS.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, a user may not have a sense of direction or know their
            left and right. Before using a GPS, they may study the route so that
            they know approximately what they are doing and can augment the
            directions of the GPS with their own context, using the GPS for
            cues. The GPS automatically reroutes them because of a small traffic
            delay. They become completely lost and disoriented and can no
            longer use the application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Letting users control when content changes gives users with cognitive disabilities more control over how
            websites and applications behave. This gives them
            the opportunity to make choices that enable them to use the content
            and complete the task.

            that saves time, the GPS tells the user about the change including how many extra

          <p>
            It is vital that users stay safe on the Internet. Information which
            suggests a user has Dementia or an intellectual disability allows
            predatory companies and individuals to target that user for scams or
            other risky activity. For example, a predatory company could send
            requests for money, saying “you haven’t made your donation” despite
            the user having made one. Avoid storing information that implies
            this or, if you do store it, provide strong security for that
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users with weak executive functioning are less likely to identify
            risks correctly so clearly identifying potential risks helps the
            user stay safe. Add helpful tips for staying safe while using your
            content and provide help in case of problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            To help identify risks, we suggest holding research and focus groups
            with people with cognitive and learning disabilities and to work
            with people with disabilities to solve potential and existing
            problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, many people who cannot copy and paste passwords or use
            two-step authorization codes ask a caregiver to help them. As
            caregivers are often just temporary employees, this leaves the user
            completely exposed. Making passwords longer or requiring users
            change them regularly increases these unsafe practices and actually
            makes the application less secure for many people. This type of
            design error is common because people with cognitive and learning
            disabilities are left out of the user research and analysis.

 		<p>Most people are familiar with a single set of units that are commonly 
		used for metrics in their location or culture. When presented with metrics 
		in other units they are required to perform a conversion in order to 
		understand the relative magnitude. This will often require using tools such 
		as a calculator or web search engine thus making content less accessible.  
		Provide in line alternatives or an option to switch units that is easily 
		selected, or perhaps based on the user’s location. Common examples are the 
		units used for distance, meters, currency and temperature.</p>

      <a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#objective-help-users-to-maintain-focus"></a></h5>
      <p>
        Distractions can cause users with cognitive disabilities problems such
        as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Losing focus on the current action;</li>
        <li>Drawing attention away from the task they are trying to do; and</li>
        <li>Difficulty for some users who don't know how to understand, avoid,
          and/or stop them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once users become distracted, they may find it
        difficult to remember what they were doing.
        Then they can no longer complete their task at all. This is especially
        problematic for users with both low attention and impaired memory, such
        as users with dementia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Items like bread crumbs can help orient the user and help the user
        restore the context when it is lost. Making breadcrumbs clickable can
        also help the user undo mistakes.

          Make sure your user testing includes individuals with a range of

            Distract the user for a minute so that they lose focus. Can they get
            easily back to the task?
          </li>
          <li>
            Ask the users if they would find this easy to do if under stress or

          <li>
            Ask the user what would help them remember what they are doing such

          Avoid interruptions. If you cannot avoid them, provide an easy way to

          <p>
            For people with memory or attention challenges, interruptions can
            make completing a task very difficult or impossible. This can
            include individuals with Dementia, those that have had a stroke or
            brain injury, and those taking medications with side effects
            impacting memory and/or attention. Certain types of interruptions or
            a certain number may cause them to give up, even if the task is very
            important. Interruptions can include sounds, content that visually
            appears or changes (e.g. ads on a page). Interruptions can be as simple as text
            notifications about the presence of new changes while working in a
            shared online document.
          </p>
          <p>
            A site will work best for those with memory or attention challenges
            if they:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Have no interruptions at all,</li>
            <li>
              Have an easy to use pause option so interruptions can be viewed
              later, or
            </li>
            <li>
              Have a setting where users can select which types of interruptions
              they prefer.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Many news websites have a lot of interruptions that can cause
            challenges for people needing to read important information, such as
            school closures due to bad weather. They may encounter breaking news
            text, advertisements, and pop-up windows. For those with difficulty
            focusing and sifting through the school names, or have two or three
            they need to check, these distractions may make the task impossible.
            By letting the user pause these distractions, and ideally
            temporarily remove them from the page, they will better be able to
            complete the task.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where standard techniques exist to remove or control distractions, they should be used.

              reminders and/or sounds, or none. For some users, not having any

          <p>
            Too much text, too many images and too much other content can cause
            cognitive overload, anxiety and loss of focus. Keeping content down
            to a small number of important points reduces the clutter, calms the
            mind and allows for better understanding whilst aiding memory. In
            particular, it helps those with a short attention span who may leave

          Pattern: Provide information so a user can prepare for and complete a task with estimated effort

        <p>Emphasize the start of important tasks.</p>
		<p>Before a user performs a task consisting of multiple steps, ensure they have an estimate of the 
		amount of effort required to complete the task. This should include:</p>
			<ul><li>The time it might take and</li>
				<li>Details of any resources needed to perform the task.</li> </ul>
		<p>Once the user starts the task, ensure the use clearly understands when the task is still “in-process” and when it has been completed.</p>

          <p>
            Some users find distractions difficult especially when the distractions cause them to switch focus mid-task and 
			subsequently return where they left off. For example, a web site may have a large arrow pointing the 
			way to the “book here” link. That emphasizes the start of the booking task, and will help users know 
			when they have started the task.
          </p>
          <p>
            Often people need to manage their times of concentration so they can focus without interruptions. 
			Thus, prior advice on the time a task takes, it’s complexity or working memory load enables them to 
			better prepare and complete without unintentional abandonment. Furthermore, the provision of a list 
			of required resources before starting the task along with an indication of the number steps left until 
			completion of the task will help avoid unwitting failures.

        Do not put barriers that stop people with cognitive disabilities from
        using or getting to content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many users have memory issues and/or language issues that can make
        remembering passwords or remembering numbers, while processing words,
        difficult or impossible. That can make transcribing text or remembering
        passwords difficult or impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes security and authentication put a barrier between users and
        the tasks they are doing. For example, requiring remembering and/or
        transcribing passwords often blocks users with cognitive disabilities
        from accessing content or using a service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes developers put a menu barrier between users and the task they
        are doing so users cannot use the content or service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Voice XML enables voice dialog systems and voice browsers. An example
        might be a phone menu system that ask you "dial 1 for internal services,
        dial 2 for external services, dial 9 for billing services." Sometimes
        users need to hold multiple pieces of transitory information in their
        minds, such as a number being presented as an option, while processing
        terms that follow. Many people with impaired short term memory cannot
        hold more than two or three pieces of information in their memory at the same
        time. As a result, they cannot complete this task and cannot get to the place they need
        to be.
      </p>
      <p>When possible, provide easy-to-use options.</p>
      <p>Note that a lot can be achieved through supporting personalization.</p>

          Make sure your user testing includes individuals with a range of
          cognitive disabilities. Do not just ask questions, but ask the user to
          complete an action that demonstrates usability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Identify the different activities that the user may want to complete
          on the page:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Can they achieve the activities without asking for help?</li>
          <li>Does the user make errors trying to achieve the activities?</li>
          <li>Does the user find the activities easy to achieve?</li>
          <li>
            Can the user do the same thing later (the password may have been
            forgotten)?
          </li>
          <li>
            Ask users if they would find this easy to do if under stress or
            tired.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ask users were they might have trouble if they are under stress.

          <p>
            Many people with week memory often lose the password and not be able
            to login and use their applications. Their solutions often are only
            sometimes helpful and have security risks:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              They may have to look at or listen to text several times to copy
              or type it into a form field;
            </li>
            <li>
              They may reuse a single password or use a simple-to-remember
              password, which they can remember.
            </li>
            <li>
              If they need to change their password or use a complicated
              password they may store passwords insecurely, such as written on
              pieces of paper which other people can see.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>They may also struggle with other steps of login, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Entering characters in the correct order;</li>
            <li>
              Entering characters correctly on the first try (resulting in being
              locked out).
            </li>
            <li>Finding a PIN;</li>
            <li>Working out puzzles or distorted letters;</li>
          </ul>
		  <p>
              They can also give up after getting frustrated with time-limited
              procedures or presentations of digital security tokens.
            </p>
          <p>
            Without this design requirement, many people cannot use an
            application or content at all. See

            people from using web services that are often critical. Many people
            cannot make doctors’ appointments, etc., by themselves. This may be
            partly responsible for the reduced life expectancy of people with

            </li>
            <li>
              Provide automatic user authentication based upon the use of a trusted

          <p>
            Many people cannot use voice menu systems and other complex systems.
            This often stops people from completing critical tasks by themselves. Often
            this can include making doctors' appointments, getting health
            insurance, reaching social services, gettig their water turned back on,
            etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            If people cannot manage voice menus by themselves, they have to ask
            someone else to help them. For example, they may delay making a
            doctor’s appointment or other critical task as not to bother their
            helper. This is a huge problem and means people often do not get the
            help they need or get it too late. This may be partly responsible
            for the lower life expectancy of people with learning and cognitive
            disabilities.
          </p>

            See
            <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/issue-papers/voice-menus.html">Voice Menu Systems</a>
            issue paper for a full discussion.
          </p>
          <p>Why can’t people use complex menus?</p>
          <ul><li>
            A good short term memory (several seconds) is essential so that the
            user can remember the number or the term for the menu. Without these
            functions the user is likely to select the wrong number.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many users have a small short term memory. For example, if you can
            remember 7 letters or items in your head at the same time they may
            be able to remember one or two. This makes them less likely to
            manage a menu system correctly.
          </li>
          <li>
            For example, a phone menu system (voice ML system) may have an
            option: "Press 3 for internal services" To use this
            option the user must remember a digit 3 while figuring out if they
            need an internal service. Many people cannot do this. It also
            requires them to press the correct digit.
          </li>
          <li>
            When a lot of irrelevant information is given before the correct
            option, the user may give up. This is especially true if they did not understand
            all the earlier options and information.
          </li></ul>
          <p>
            The 0 digit should be reserved for reaching a person. Consistently
            set the first option for each menu to: "to weight for a person who
            can help you press 0". This can help everyone reach the support they
            need.

          <p>Considerations for Speech Recognition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For speech recognition based systems, an existing ETSI standard
              for voice commands for many European languages exists and should
              be used where possible [ETSI 202 076], keeping in mind that
              expecting people to learn more than a few commands places a burden
              on the user.
            </li>
            <li>
              Natural language understanding systems allow users to state their
              requests in their own words, and can be useful for users who have
              difficulty remembering menu options, or who have difficulty
              mapping the offered menu options to their goals. However, natural
              language interfaces can be difficult to use for users who have
              difficulty producing speech or language. Directed dialog
              (menu-based) fallback or transfer to an agent should be provided.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Follow requirements of legislation</p>
          <p>
            For example, the U.S. Telecommunications Act Section 255
            Accessibility Guidelines [Section255] paragraph 1193.41 Input,
            control, and mechanical functions, clauses (g), (h) and (i) apply to
            cognitive disabilities and require that equipment should be operable
            without time-dependent controls, the ability to speak, and should be
            operable by persons with limited cognitive skills.

            Ensure this pattern is included in important systems that affect health, finance,
            communication, water and government services. Unimportant systems, that do not affect the users' health, safety,
            money or rights should incorporate as much of this pattern as possible.

          Each step in a sequential process must contain the information
          necessary to allow a user to proceed. They must rely on memory from
          prior steps. When useful, provide a summary of information from
          previous steps, and a mechanism for traversing the process.

            Often content has barrier which prevent users with learning
            disability from completing a step, and as a result, prevents them
            from achieving whatever they wished to achieve.
          </p>
          <p>
            This often happens in multi-step user-interaction dialogs, such as
            voice-menu systems, but it can happen in any task including online
            shopping or forms.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Some systems assume that all users have a good working memory.
              They present several choices to the user and ask them to select
              one choice, whether by speaking or through a key press. The user
              needs hold multiple pieces of transitory information in the mind.
              For example, many users have a small short term memory. For example,
              a phone menu system (voice ML system) may have an option: "press 3
              for internal services" To use this option the user must remember a
              digit 3 whilst figuring out if they need an internal service. Many
              people cannot do this. It also requires them to press the correct
              digit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reduced executive function may also cause problems. Sometime the
              user needs more time to complete a task. But she can be problems
              also if when the system response is too slow. The user may not
              know whether their input has registered with the system, and
              consequently may press the key or speak again.
            </li>
            <li>
              The use needs may need to compare similar options such as
              "billing", "accounts", "sales" and decide which is the service
              that is best suited to solve the issue at hand. Without strong
              reasoning skills the user is likely to select the wrong menu
              option.
            </li>
            <li>
              Advertisements and additional, unrequested information also
              increase the amount of processing required.
            </li>
            <li>
              The use needs to focus on the different options and select the
              correct one. A person with impaired attention may have not be able
              to focus for a long or multi-level menu. Advertising and
              additional, unrequested information also make it harder to retain
              attention.
            </li>
            <li>
              The user needs to interpret the correct terms and match them to
              their needs within a certain time limit. This involves speech
              perception and language understanding: sounds of language are
              heard, interpreted and understood, within a given time.
            </li>
            <li>
              The user needs to understand the terms used in the menu, even if
              they are not relevant to the service options required.
            </li>
            <li>
              When a lot of irrelevant information is given before the correct
              option the user may give up, especially if they did not understand
              all the earlier options and information.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Allowing the 0 digit to get to a person, or having the first option
            "to weight for a person who can help you press 0" can consistently
            help.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each step in a sequential process must contain the information
            necessary to allow a user to proceed. They must NOT rely on memory
            from prior steps. When useful, provide a summary of information from
            previous steps, and an easy mechanism for traversing the process is

            Follow best practices in general
            <abbr title="voice user interfaces">VUI</abbr> design
          </p>
          <p>
            Standard best practices in voice user interface apply to users with
            cognitive disabilities, and should be followed. A good reference is
            published by The Association for Voice Interaction Design Wiki
            [AVIxD]. Another good reference is [ETSI ETR 096]. Some examples of
            generally accepted best practices in voice user interface design:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Pauses are important between phrases in order to allow processing
              time of language and options.
            </li>
            <li>
              Options in text should be given before the digit to select, or the
              instruction to select that option. This will mean that the user
              does not need to remember the digit or instruction whilst
              processing the term. For example: The prompt "press 1 for the
              secretary," requires the user to remember the digit 1 while
              interpreting the term "secretary". A better prompt is "for the
              secretary (pause): press 1" or " for the secretary (pause) or for
              more help (pause): press 1"
            </li>
            <li>
              Error recovery should be simple, and take the user to a human
              operator if the error persists. Error responses should not end the
              call or send the user to a more complex menu.
            </li>
            <li>
              Advertisements and other extraneous information should not be read
              as it can confuse the user and can make it harder to retain
              attention.
            </li>
            <li>Terms used should be as simple and jargon-free as possible.</li>
            <li>
              Tapered prompts should be used to increase the level of prompt
              detail when the user does not respond as expected.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            See the AVIxD wiki cited above for additional recommendation and
            detail.
          </p>
          <p><strong>User settings</strong></p>
          <p>
            User-specific settings can be used to customize the voice user
            interface (such as menus, and options), keeping in mind that the
            available mechanisms for invoking user-specific settings are minimal
            in a voice interface (speech or DTMF tones). If it is difficult to
            set user preferences, they won't be used. Setting preferences by
            natural language is the most natural ("slow down!") but is not
            currently very common.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Extra time should be a user setting for both the speed of speech
              and ability for the user to define if they need a slower speech or
              more input time etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Timed text should be adjustable (as with all accessible media).
            </li>
            <li>
              The user should be able to extend or disable time out as a system
              default on their device
            </li>
            <li>
              Error recovery should be simple, and take you to a human operator.
              Error response should not though the user off the line or send
              them to a more complex menu. Preferably they should use a reserved
              digit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Timed text should be adjustable (as with all accessible media).
            </li>
            <li>
              Advertisement and other information should not be read as it can
              confuse the user and can make it harder to retain attention.
            </li>
            <li>Terms used should be as simple as possible.</li>
            <li>
              Examples and advice should be given on how to build a prompt that
              reduces the cognitive load
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Example 1: Reducing cognitive load: The prompt "press 1 for
                  the secretary," requires the user to remember the digit 1
                  while interpreting the term secretary. It is less good then
                  the prompt "for the secretary (pause): press 1" or " for the
                  secretary (pause) or for more help (pause): press 1"
                </li>
                <li>
                  Example 2: Setting a default for a human operator as the
                  number 0

            <li>
              For speech recognition based systems, an existing ETSI standard
              for voice commands for many European languages exists and should
              be used where possible [ETSI 202 076], keeping in mind that
              expecting people to learn more than a few commands places a burden
              on the user.
            </li>
            <li>
              Natural language understanding systems allow users to state their
              requests in their own words, and can be useful for users who have
              difficulty remembering menu options, or who have difficulty
              mapping the offered menu options to their goals. However, natural
              language interfaces can be difficult to use for users who have
              difficulty producing speech or language. Directed dialog
              (menu-based) fallback or transfer to an agent should be provided.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Follow requirements of legislation</p>
          <p>
            For example, the U.S. Telecommunications Act Section 255
            Accessibility Guidelines [Section255] paragraph 1193.41 Input,
            control, and mechanical functions, clauses (g), (h) and (i) apply to
            cognitive disabilities and require that equipment should be operable
            without time-dependent controls, the ability to speak, and should be
            operable by persons with limited cognitive skills.

          Make sure your user testing includes individuals with a range of
          cognitive disabilities. Do not just ask questions, but ask the user to
          complete an action that demonstrates usability.
        </p>
        <p>Test for the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Are enough user groups represented?</li>
          <li>
            For example, a typical project may wish to include: People living
            with early stage dementia, age appropriate forgetfulness,
            intellectual disabilities, different specific learning disabilities
            and communication disorders.

          <li>
            Can the user find a way to submit their feedback without asking for
            help?

          <li>
            Can the user submit their feedback at each stage of the process

          </li>
          <li>
            Ask the users if they would find this easy to do if under stress or

          <li>
            Ask the user where they might have trouble if they were under

          <li>
            Does the user understand the feedback process and are they able to
            complete the task? Use concrete ways to check that the user
            understands. For example: Is the user able to identify if/when they
            will receive a response back? The method a response back may come
            (e.g. email, phone). Where the feedback goes/what happens to the
            feedback?
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure it is simple to use and does not require a lot of
            information that will prevent people from giving feedback.
          </li>
          <li>
            Confirm it is available at different stages in the process and is
            one click away.
          </li>
          <li>
            Confirm that when feedback is given and a process is in place for

          <p>
            The use of complex information, long documents and data in a
            particular format can present significant barriers to users with
            cognitive accessibility needs. Users should be able to understand
            the information and successfully complete described tasks without
            requiring further external assistance as much as possible. If
            content is sufficiently complex to cause barrier, it may be
            inaccessible and then additional supporting help should be provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            The complexity of information may be inherent in the information
            itself, for example the language used, the quantity of information,
            or the subject matter. In this case, it is likely to need careful
            explanation, organization and presentation for all users to be able
            to understand without any mistakes, confusion or need of assistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the presentation mode of information, such as a graph,
            diagram or table, may obscure its meaning through complexity. Here,
            a supporting description and guided interpretation will highlight
            the key features the user needs to understand.
          </p>
          <p>Help may be provided in various forms, for example:</p>

                <li>
                  However, as some people have difficulty remembering symbols,

          Provide help for any complex forms, particularly when there are
          multiple steps, unusual interactions, non-standard controls and
          required fields that do not support autocomplete. Give examples

          <p>
            Users often find forms and related tasks to be the most complex
            experience with web sites and can easily become confused, unsure, or
            even completely lost. Providing extra help can make the difference
            between being able to successfully complete a task and giving up.
            This is especially true if any part of the form is complex or
            provides nonstandard interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many standard forms controls provide support automatically. For
            example, many fields can be automatically fill it all in the
            information using autocomplete or personalization semantics. Then
            the user will not make mistakes filling it out.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you require additional fields and nonstandard controls many
            users will have difficulty filling it in. Many users with
            disabilities will get the information incorrect or be unable to work
            out how to complete the task. Often this results in the task being
            completely abandoned. In other cases, the user asks a care giver for
            help to complete the form or work the control. In either case, they
            have not been able to complete the task because of their disability.

            The standard HTML forms and controls have been carefully specified
            for maximum usability and accessibility. They are usually understood
            by users, especially if they are familiar with web interactions.
            However, users are likely to experience difficulties if the standard
            form behavior has been altered or completely new controls are
            provided. Assuming the new behaviors have been carefully designed
            and user tested, users may still require help in order to
            successfully use them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples of forms and controls that are likely to require additional
            help:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              New behaviors like bank sort code fields where there is auto
              tabbing between the 3 boxes as digits are entered;
            </li>
            <li>
              Password fields that require certain character types of characters
              to be entered;
            </li>
            <li>
              Surveys with complex interactions, for example where buttons only
              appear depending on previous answers;
            </li>
            <li>
              Date entry where there could be some ambiguity about the required
              format;
            </li>
            <li>custom controls like date pickers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Help can be provided via various mechanisms, perhaps with an
            accessible help button next to a nonstandard control.

              information required. This will also benefit users of Assistive

            For example, a user of a travel site is booking a trip to Geneva. They see an option at a good time, but this ticket 
			is to a different city. They assume the options give are to the location they asked for. They check the dates and times, 
			but, because they cannot read quickly, do not double check the destination. They are taken to a different location, 
			and as a vulnerable user end up at night without accommodation.

            In another example, a user sees a laptop for sale at a good price. They do not see the refurbished word in the

            automatically add events and deadlines to their own calendar can
            help in many cases, for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When the user copies information into a calendar they often copy
              the day or time incorrectly.
            </li>
            <li>
              The user is challenged processing and retaining time based
              information.
            </li>
            <li>The user is challenged in sequencing time bound events.</li>
            <li>
              The user's skills decrease when tired to such an extent that they
              have to stop a task. They may wish to reschedule the task.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, a user with a learning disability set a doctor's
            appointment online. Often they copy the detailing incorrectly onto
            their calendar. However, the website gives them an option to add the
            appointment to the calendar and sets a reminder an hour before. The
            user now comes to the correct place at the correct time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The benefit to users with cognitive accessibility needs is that they
            can independently manage appointments, deadlines and schedules. The
            ability to set reminders can reduce the cognitive load associated
            when processing time bound tasks. Time dependent activities may be
            monitored and tracked by the user to ensure that they are completed
            in a timely manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Always give the option to set a reminder at the end of the task so
            that the user does not get interrupted.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is essential not to add unwanted reminders as this makes the
            user's calendar too full. This can even prevent them from being able
            to use their calendar at all. The user is the best person to know
            how many reminders, and which type, will best meet their needs.

            Date and time sensitive events are any event that has to be
            completed by a certain time. The time constraints on such an event
            may be defined by a calendar date and time or by the total elapsed
            time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Variables that could be considered on 'when to supply a reminder'
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Time - at a logical time</li>
            <li>Location - prompted when at an appropriate location</li>
            <li>Context - on computer vs. mobile, on specific site, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This design pattern addresses two broad classes of issues associated
            with this type of information:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If the user perceives the activity to be too complex the user may
              decide to abandon the activity and therefore be excluded from the
              information and/or services derived from the completion of the
              activity.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the activity relies on a number of distinct events being
              carried out sequentially over an extended period of time or if a
              single event must be completed by a specified date and time then
              the likelihood of errors being made during the activity increases,
              particularly for users with cognitive accessibility needs.
              Activities are often missed because the date and time is confused.

          <li>
            Easy to Use: Feedback information and forms are simple and clear.

            comments. If users cannot give feedback easily, problems will
            continue to exist without the site owner being aware of the
            problems. It is important to allow users to provide feedback from any point in the process so that people do not get lost when trying to explain why they are stuck.
			Ideas for improvements and positive feedback will also be
            missed.

          </ul>

          <p>
            Providing multiple methods for gathering feedback is recommended.
            For example, on a website, consider providing all 4 options for
            feedback including live chat, a phone number, a web form and a
            feedback email address.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that chat bots may not be appropriate for this particular type
            of feedback other than to start the feedback process. These can be
            extremely frustrating if you cannot easily get to the area you are
            trying to reach.

            A banking website had a major accessibility problem. This problem
            blocked some customers from paying their bills online. One of these
            customers found a feedback form on the page where they got stuck.
            The customer was able to report the problem. A help desk employee
            reached out to the customer and helped them complete their bill
            payment successfully. That help desk employee also reported the
            accessibility problem to the software team. The software team
            corrected the problem in the next software release. The new design
            was easier for all users and resulted in more customers successfully

      <p>
        Personalization can enable us to really meet the individual user’s
        needs. Some users need extra support which we can provide with minimal
        effort from the user via personalization. Personalization allows the
        user to select preferred options from a set of alternatives. Some
        alternatives may be provided by the content author or app developer and
        others may be semi-automated. This can include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Familiar symbols and graphics that the user knows;</li>
        <li>Tool tips;</li>
        <li>
          Language they understand such as literal language or common terms;
        </li>
        <li>
          Less features and options to the optimum number for the individual
          user;
        </li>
        <li>Keyboard short cuts that are familiar to the user;</li>
        <li>Widgets for help.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Personalization also helps with the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sometimes user needs conflict;</li>
        <li>
          Learning new designs, patterns and widgets can be confusing - we want
          to allow users use widgets they already know;
        </li>
        <li>Extra support can be annoying to people who do not need it;</li>
        <li>
          Making content predictable is necessary for accessibility for some
          people but can often be considered boring design for other users;
        </li>
        <li>
          Ability to change levels of complexity and simplify the content is
          important as people skills improve or decrease over time or context.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One use-case we would like to see is providing interoperable symbol set
        codes for non-verbal users. Products for people who are non-vocal often
        use symbols to help users communicate. These symbols are in fact people's
        language. Unfortunately, many of these symbols are both subject to copy
        write and are not interoperable. That means end-users can only use one
        device, and can-not use apps or AT from a different company. An open set
        of references for symbol codes for these symbol sets however, could be
        interoperable. That means the end user could use an open source symbol
        set or buy the symbols and use them across different devices or
        applications. Symbols could still be proprietary but they would also be
        interoperable.

          <p>
            For example, a user with traumatic brain injury has executive
            function and memory impairments impacting their ability to remember
            details such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Internet of Things (IoT) interface</li>
            <li>Their user name and password</li>
            <li>What an acronym stands for</li>
            <li>A phone number</li>
            <li>The meaning of uncommon words</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Supporting the use of an add-on that simplifies content and adds
            help (such as the long form of acronyms, and a popup dictionary)
            enables them to understand most content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Supporting password management tools enables him to successfully
            login and avoid being locked out of secure sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Storing non-sensitive information and auto complete helps them fill
            out a form. This suggests common information, like a person's phone
            number or address. It also helps them avoid making mistakes. It
            eliminates the need for accurately recalling this information from
            memory or having to copy and paste it, which is a task that often
            prevent them from successfully using a form.
          </p>
          <p>
            When overwhelmed by textual content, they have an extension that
            inserts symbols that they are familiar with that helps them find the
            content they need.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, sometimes a web site stops their extensions and API’s from
            working. The result is that the use cannot use this web site.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another example is a person that has a language related disability
            (e.g. Dyslexia) which may cause them to read at a slower rate. They
            often miss objects and information that they did not know they
            needed to read. While high-literacy readers scan text, low-literacy
            users may read the text “word-for-word.” This means they only know
            what is written when they have intentionally read out. This is
            similar to having a narrow field of view and they can be unaware of
            other items not directly in the flow of text that they are reading.
            They may also miss things on the page that help them understand what
            to do. For example, there may be a side bar or call out box which
            helps make decisions about which link to go to that matches their
            particular needs. These readers may select the earlier option they
            encounter, because they may not have noticed (or prioritized)
            reading that side bar content. They also might miss information that
            is essential for successfully completing an interaction.
          </p>

          <p>
            Too many options may add to the complexity of interacting with IoT
            devices. Additional options should be easy to ignore and not require
            a lot of reading to understand that they are additional, as well as
            how to skip them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes IoT interfaces may confuse the user, such as a default
            "reading" on a meter being set to “2” and not “1.” The user would
            then need to reset it to “1.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important in any proposed solution to make operational tasks,
            such as interacting with the IoT, as transparent as possible so that
            users can focus their attention on the functional aspects, such as
            relating to content.

            A user who has difficulty reading or using Web content can be easily
            overwhelmed with too much information on a web page. They need to
            simplify the page to just the critical information that they need
            and not spend all their energy reading and understanding other
            content and features. This is also true for users who are easily
            distracted.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, an email program has lots of features and formatting
            options when drafting an email. This makes it too complex for a lot
            of people. With personalization the user can have a simple option
            with only send and cancel options. There is a “to” and subject line
            but no cc or bcc options. In this setting there is a clear heading
            (write an email) and they have icons that the user understands.

		<li>Adding semantics on controls, links and symbols that allows the user to control the experience. For example:

          <p>
            Personalization changes the interface to meet the needs of the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having familiar terms and symbols is key to many users being able to
            use the web. However, what is familiar for one user may be
            unfamiliar to another requiring them to learn new symbols. Adding
            semantics allow symbols and support to be added by an extension or
            browser that is familiar to the individual user.
          </p>
          <p>
            A stronger example is people using Alternative and Augmentative
            Communication (AAC) systems. AAC systems designed for people who are
            non-verbal often use symbols with or without text.
          </p>
          <p>
            These users usually only learn one symbol set. They cannot easily
            communicate with other symbol users in a written format or may
            struggle to understand different symbols used in different
            applications. Some symbols are subject to copyright and cannot be
            shared across applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            If users' symbols are mapped to the same concepts, then user agents
            can load the symbols that are understandable by the user and they
            user can access the web and other applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other support includes autocomplete and extension that help the user
            fill out forms and understand the content. Many users with memory or
            executive functions impairments could not fill in forms without
            asking someone to help copy over information or check their work.
            Autocomplete, many more users to manage forms by themselves.

            guide is divided into objectives. There are also user stories and
            testing methodologies for each objective. Just understanding the
            objectives and user stories may help make your content more accessible
            to some users with cognitive and learning disabilities. Please see the
            section on user testing for guidance on how to perform COGA user
            testing.
            <p>The objectives are:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Design so that as many users as possible understand the site
                    and know how to use it:

        <p><strong>Example recommendations for policies:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A policy for critical services might include any item with a high or
            medium level need
          </li>
          <li>A policy for emergency services might include all items</li>
          <li>
            A policy for legislation for wide adoption for all web sites might
            include any item that are testable, does not require human testing
            and have a high user need level.
          </li>
          <li>
            A policy for legislation for content needed in the workplace might
            include any item that are testable, and have a high or medium level
            user need level.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>The following are example scenarios that may be included in a
            policy:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Critical services - such as water, health care, phone and internet
            services, government services
          </li>
          <li>Emergency services - such as police, fire, etc</li>
          <li>Content needed in the workplace, including professional sites</li>
          <li>
            Content that helps autonomy such as apps and interfaces to run home
            devices, book a cab, write an email etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The following are example user considerations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Safety</li>
          <li>Autonomy and savings in care-giving</li>
          <li>
            Cost associated with people leaving the work place earlier than
            necessary.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Other considerations include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Does this item require user testing to conform, and is this too
            expensive for the scope of sites that might be required to comply
          </li>
