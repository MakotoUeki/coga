<dt>Age Appropriate Forgetfulness</dt>
	<dd>Sometimes called "age related memory loss"</dd>
	<dd>People with age appropriate forgetfulness have impaired memory issues that can be a normal part of healthy aging. They may take longer to learn new things, forget something but remember it later, or occasionally forget particular words. (This differs from dementia where forgetfulness is due to a  disorder and is more pronounced.)</dd>
<dt>Alternative and Augmentative Communication System</dt>
	<dd>Sometimes referred to as "AAC"</dd>
	<dd>Any method, device or app that can be used to help those who cannot use spoken language and need additional support by means of symbols, images and/or text. For example a screen with symbols that the user can select to speak the appropriate words or add them to a document.</dd>
<dt>Anxiety Disorders</dt>
	<dd>People who have anxiety disorders struggle with intense and uncontrollable feelings of anxiety, fear, worry, and/or panic. This is more than just feeling worried once in a while. This may last for a long time and can interfere with daily activities, such as concentration and executive functioning.</dd>
<dt>Attention Deficit (hyperactivity) disorder, AD(H)D</dt>
	<dd>Sometimes called Attention deficit disorder, ADD, and Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD</dd>
	<dd>Attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder or AD(H)D involves difficulty focusing on a single task, focusing for longer periods, or being easily distracted. It is marked by an ongoing pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development.</dd>
