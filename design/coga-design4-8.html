			<h1>Introduction</h1>

			<p>Making websites and applications that are friendly for people with cognitive impairments affects every part of design and development.</p>
			<p>Traditionally accessibility has been most focused on the interface, and making that usable for people with sensory and physical impairments in vision, hearing and/or mobility. Some accessibility features will help people with cognitive impairments, but often the issues are about context, language, usability, and other more general factors that impact everyone to some degree.</p>
			<p>This document aims to provide guidance on how to make websites and applications that are friendly for people with cognitive impairments by providing guidance for your designs, and design process.</p>
			<p>This guide is divided into design themes. There are also user stories, testing methodologies, and design checkpoints for each theme. Just understanding the themes and user stories may help make your content more accessible to some users with cognitive and learning disabilities. Please see the section on user testing for guidance on how to perform COGA user testing.</p>
			<p class="ednote">EDITOR’S note: This is an early draft. We expect many editorial changes to make the content more clear and easy to understand. We will also change the format along the lines of https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/</p>

				<h3>Make the purpose of your page clear</h3>
				<p>Use a  clear title or heading that summarizes the purpose of a page, or other clear signposts that have been tested by users with cognitive disabilities.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps </h4>
					<p>This helps many people, including those with poor memory, attention, or anyone who is easily distracted. This includes people with age-appropriate forgetfulness, or Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.</p>
					<p>For example, someone with mild dementia is using online shopping. They get distracted and then when they look at the screen again they have forgotten what they were doing. Put a clear heading at the top of each page that shows clearly <strong>what the page is about and what they are doing</strong>.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<p>Heading need to clarify the purpose of this specific page</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> example:  Headings tell me exactly where I am</p>
					<!-- <div><img alt="Headings tell me exactly where I am" src="img/tell-me-where-success.png" height="486" width="700"></div> -->
					<p><strong>Failure </strong>example: Heading that doesn't clarify the step in a form</p>
					<p><strong>Todo: add this example </strong></p>
					<p><strong>Failure </strong>example: Service not available…. what service? </p>
					<p>I have to remember what I was doing to know what service this is about.</p>
					<!-- <div><img alt="Service not available" src="service-not-available-failure.png" height="486" width="600"></div> -->
