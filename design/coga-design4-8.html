			<h1>Introduction</h1>

			<p>Making websites and applications that are friendly for people with cognitive impairments affects every part of design and development.</p>
			<p>Traditionally accessibility has been most focused on the interface, and making that usable for people with sensory and physical impairments in vision, hearing and/or mobility. Some accessibility features will help people with cognitive impairments, but often the issues are about context, language, usability, and other more general factors that impact everyone to some degree.</p>
			<p>This document aims to provide guidance on how to make websites and applications that are friendly for people with cognitive impairments by providing guidance for your designs, and design process.</p>
			<p>This guide is divided into design themes. There are also user stories, testing methodologies, and design checkpoints for each theme. Just understanding the themes and user stories may help make your content more accessible to some users with cognitive and learning disabilities. Please see the section on user testing for guidance on how to perform COGA user testing.</p>
			<p class="ednote">This is an early draft. We expect many editorial changes to make the content more clear and easy to understand. We will also change the format along the lines of https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/</p>
			<p class="ednote">TODO Objective 1 - 3 sections go here</p>
		</section>

		<section id="objective-4">
			<h2>Objective: Prevent the user from making mistakes and make it easy to correct mistakes when they do occur.</h2>
			<p>A good design and use of scripts will make errors less likely, but when they do occur the user should know how to correct them easily without stess or extra steps.</p>
			<p>Completing forms and similar tasks is often overwhelming for most users with cognitive and learning disabilities. This includes relatively minor learning disabilities, such as Dyslexia, or attention related disabilities. </p>
			<p>Many users with learning disabilities cannot remember numbers, such as those for their post/zip code, Social Security, or credit card. Many users even need to check their phone numbers. This makes entering information slow, and they may need to leave their desks or take breaks. </p>
			<p>Also many users have short term memory issues that can make copying text difficult or impossible. For example, if you can remember 7 letters in your head at the same time. They may be able to remember one or two. This makes them much more likely to make mistakes copying as it requires you to remember the numbers or letter accurately.</p>
			<p>Note that a lot can be achieved through supporting personalization.</p>
			<section>
				<h3>User testing</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Can they easily fill in the form without making mistakes?</li>
					<li>Was it pleasant to fill out the form? How is their mood changed?</li>
					<li>Ask the users if they would find this easy to do if under stress or tiered?</li>
					<li>Ask the user if anything was hard.</li>
					<li>Ask the user how the form could be easier to fill out. Suggest some of the relevant design techniques bellow and ask if it would help them with this form </li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>User stories</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>As a user who needs to look up my postal/zip code, I do not want a session to time out while I try to find the information needed.</li>
					<li>As a user who needs to take breaks during tasks, such as completing a form, I want to be sure all my work is saved automatically if my computer crashes. I do not want to have to start over again, which can create a cycle of reentering my data; and making me more tired and more likely to make mistakes.</li>
					<li>As a user with difficulty typing numbers in the right order, I want an interface that makes mistakes less likely.</li>
					<li>As a user who finds entering information stressful, I want to enter as little information as I can so the task is more manageable.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Pattern: Build forms so that people make less mistakes</h3>
				<ul>
					<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#input-errordef">Input errors</a> should be automatic corrected (where the correction is reliable) if suggestions for corrections are known, the suggestions are provided to the user</p><li>In a text field, accept as many formats as possible. For example accept different formats of  phone numbers and correct <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#input-errordef">Input errors</a> automatically</li>
					<li>Use an interface were only valid  input can be selected</li>
					<li>Accept voice prompts for people with a speech impairment</li>
					<li>Use the default format of the users  location such as currency and temperature </li>
					<li>Use autocomplete and personalization of form controls</li>
				</ul>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>People with cognitive or learning disabilities and aging users often abandon tasks and believe they cannot complete them if they receive too many errors. Error messages may be confusing.  Correcting errors is often difficult and frustrating for the user. Many users give up when they get successive errors</p>
					<p>For example, while registering for an online banking account a form requires the input of the user's birthdate. The required input format is xx/xx/xxxx with a leading zero for single digits. If a single input field with no input correction is presented, a user with a cognitive disability may enter 1/3/1996 thus triggering an error notification. It may not be clear to the user that the required format is 01/03/1996 even if an example for instance, xx/xx/xxxx, is shown below the input field or in the error notification. </p>
					<p>However a well designed form will make it easier to fill in the information and prevent the user from making mistakes.</p>
					<p>Image of options being restricted to valid inputs</p>
					<!-- <div>
						<img alt="Image of options being restricted to valid inputs" src="img/restricted-to-valid-inputs.png" width="200" height="150">
					</div> -->
					<p>Autocomplete </p>
					<!-- <div>
						<img alt="Autocomplete" src="img/site-using-autocomplete.png" height="500" width="600">
					</div> -->
					<p>Minimizing user generated errors by automatically correcting them will also minimize error notifications. Error notifications may be distracting taking focus away from tasks and task completion. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Only correct errors if the correction is reliable. Otherwise, if suggestions for corrections are known, give the suggestions to the user. 
							<ul>
								<li>For example, “did you mean the first of February (01/02) or the second of January (02/01)</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Calendars and dates
							<ul>
								<li>Calendars should default to the first relevant day. Work calendars should default to first working day of a user's locale.</li>
								<li>Calendar based booking systems must avoid ability to book return date before departure date.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Temperature
							<ul>
								</li>Use the default temperature format of location. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Success </strong>Example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Correct errors of the post code being written in the text field with the city or state information</li>
						<li>User is unable to select inappropriate dates and a simple explanation provided should he/she try to do so.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Failure </strong>Examples:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The booking form provides two calendars without clear labels and instruction and user is able to select dates without warning as to whether they are possible e.g. flight out on June 1st - flight return May 30th</li>
						<li>User can select inappropriate dates without warning. Calendar merely grays out inappropriate dates which may not be noticed. No warnings provided.</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Pattern: Make it easy to undo errors</h3>
				<p>Allow the user to check their work before submitting a form so that they can correct any mistakes.Once they have fixed their mistake it should be easy to get back to the place they were at (without redoing extra steps).</p>
				<p><strong>For financial transactions and important information: </strong>Allow the user to easily cancel the transactions and provide simple instructions including the amount of time the user has to cancel a transaction.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>People with cognitive and learning impairments make many more mistakes in filling out forms than the general population. When mistakes cannot be easily corrected they can not complete the task.</p>
					<p>This helps people with cognitive disabilities for safely using forms and reduces the consequences that are the result of a mistake.</p>
					<p>For example, a user with a memory impairment may not remember that they have already added an item to their shopping cart and may add the item a second time. They may confused the dates when booking a trip, and many other mistakes. </p>
					<p>It is essential that people with cognitive impairments have the opportunity to check their work AND can fix their mistakes easily.</p>
					<p>For people with cognitive disabilities, mistakes being theoretically reversible is not enough. Often the process of reversing a transaction is too complex for them to manage without help. They may not have access to that help meaning they have to live with all the mistakes they have made. For example, when inputting credit card information incorrectly these mistakes can be devastating. In addition if the process of correcting mistakes is too difficult, users may give up, either losing the transaction or buying unwanted items because of the one required item.</p>
					<p>The effect of this happening multiple times is devastating and can result in a large number of users with disabilities stopping to use the Internet for many tasks.</p>
					<p>Allowing the user to change the number of items in the shopping cart at any time can significantly reduce the chances of these mistakes. </p>
					<p>A summary of the order, including product quantities and other costs before the final submission, gives the user the chance to identify any errors and make changes to the order.In this example given, a summary of the purchase helps the user  see the error in quantity as well as a higher than expected order total.</p>
					<p> In some cases a user may realize that a mistake has been made after the final submission of data. Simple language instructions on how to cancel transactions and  helping  the user understanding the amount of time the user has to cancel a transaction and makes them less susceptible to scams</p>
					<p>In another example, a user with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder purchasing a travel ticket on a website may struggle with details and may have a low attention span. The successful completion of the order relies on the information provided at multiple steps in the process.An error due to lack of accuracy or attention to detail such as an incorrect street number or zip code in the billing address will result in the order not going though. If a summary is not provided before submitting the final order or is not clear the user may not understand the reason for the declined payment and give up on the order. The user may also give up if there is not an easy way to make correction, and all the order needs to be redone.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<p>This typically includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Change: It is simple for the user to review all the data and correct mistakes, including mistakes that might not be automatically identified. The user can change information via clearly labeled actions and get back to the place they were at, in one clearly labeled action without unwanted loss of data. (Some data may need to be entered if it is dependent on the item that was changed.)</li>
						<li>Confirmed: A summary is provided before submitting important information and the user is told when they are about to submit the final information.</li>
						<li>Time frames and instruction for cancelling transactions are clear and easy to follow.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Getting started</h4>
					<p>Start with forms were a mistake can have serious consequences such as financial loss or vulnerability.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples </h4>
					<p><strong>Success </strong>examples:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Provide a summary before submitting important information. Make it clearly labelled to repair information and one click to return to the summary</li>
						<li>Provide clickable breadcrumbs that allow users to see the previous steps, go back, and change them</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Failure </strong>examples:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Provide a summary before submitting important information. But it is hard to repair the information</li>
						<li>Provide a summary before submitting important information. But then you have to redo a lot of other non-dependent information </li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Pattern: Use clear labels and instructions</h3>
				<p>Provide clear instructions up front when appropriate that is clear, concise, and accessible. Ensure labels are also clear.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps </h4>
					<p>Clear instructions help prevent user errors up front. This reduces frustration and enhances the user’s autonomy and independence because they can avoid asking for help. This helps anybody with memory issues, people new to culture, people on autism spectrum who may miss cultural context.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details [optional]</h4>
					<p>Provide instructions at the start of the process, not simply in an error message.</p>

					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Provide an image of a passport with the number highlighted to indicate where the number is that the user should enter.</li>
						<li>Explicitly say which day of the week is the start (e.g., Sunday or Monday) in calendar control when booking a hotel.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Failure </strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Request a passport number, but the passport may have several numbers and the user is uncertain which is requested.</li>
						<li>Site does not clarify start of week, and user reads calendar control wrong and books hotel for wrong day.</li>

				<h3>Pattern: Provide flexibility in form inputs</h3>
				<p class="ednote">This is a new Pattern added by Gareth, Jamie, Michael during the face to face. It was inspied by "Use clear labels and instructions"</p>
				<p>Be forgiving of contextual variations in user input such as currency, time zone, and locale.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps </h4>
					<p>Forgiving form entry processes help prevent user errors up front. This reduces frustration and enhances the user’s autonomy and independence because they can avoid asking for help. This helps anybody with memory issues, people new to culture, people on the autism spectrum who may miss cultural context.</p>

					<h4>Getting started [optional]</h4>
					<p>For inputs that collect known data types, such as credit card or telephone numbers or geography names, accept common variations on the input format so users don’t have to convert or receive avoidable error messages.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>User inputting a financial value can specify the currency used, even if different from the site’s.</li>
						<li>User inputs a credit card number with or without spaces, and the information is accepted.</li>
						<li>User inputs telephone number as written including country code, region code, and number using brackets.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Failure </strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>User inputs value thinking it is US dollars, but the web site processes in Euros.</li>
						<li>User inputs credit number with spaces only to be told it must include numbers only.</li>
						<li>User inputs telephone number but is told it must include numbers only.</li>

				<h3>Pattern: Avoid data loss and "time outs"</h3>
				<p class="ednote">This needs reworking, including extracting the examples from the text</p>
				<p>Avoid timeouts. When this is not possible, inform user of the amount of time required to complete the process (before timeout) and if user will lose entered data if a timeout occurs. </p>
				<section>
					<h3>How it helps </h3>
					<p>The use of timed events can present significant barriers for users with cognitive disabilities, as these users may require more time to read content or to perform functions, such as completing an online form.</p>
					<p>During the completion of an online process for reserving a hotel room and purchasing a plane ticket, a user with a cognitive impairment may become overwhelmed with the amount of instruction and data input required to complete the process. The user may not be able to complete the process in one sitting, and may need to take a break. Users should be able to leave a process without losing their current place within the process, and without losing data that have already been entered. If users cannot take a break and check their work, many will often be unable to complete a task correctly.</p>
					<p>While making a purchase on an e-commerce Web site, a user with a cognitive disability may not remember required information (e.g., a phone number or a zip code) that may seem easy to remember for users without a cognitive impairment. Users with cognitive disabilities may need additional time to look up the information required to complete a transaction, without losing their place in the process, and without losing data that have already been entered.</p>
					<p>In another example, users’ cognitive skills may temporarily diminish as they get tired. They then must stop the task for that day, and continue it when they are feeling better, and when their reading or processing skills are back to their higher levels.</p>
					<p>For situations where the absence of a timed event would significantly change the intended functionality of an application (e.g., an auction or another real-time event), it is important to ensure that users with disabilities are properly notified. Notifications should include information about timed events, and an indication of the duration of the time given. As well, they should include mechanisms clearly labelled to adjust, extend, or stop the duration of an event, to allow users to fully engage and interact with Web content and functionality. For example, if an e-commerce Web site's checkout process provides secure credit card transactions, the user is notified of the timeout, and is given at least 120 seconds to extend it.</p>
					<p>These experiences have been reported by members of the task force who have various cognitive impairments. There is significant user research indicating that timed events rarely help anyone; and can cause stress and frustration.</p>
					<p>It should be noted that many users, within 20 seconds, cannot read instructions to extend a time limit. We thus extended the time limit to 120 seconds.</p>
					<p>We also require simple text conforming to the understandable language design requirement.</p>
					<p>This helps users who need additional time performing tasks or reading content. This can include the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A Web site uses a client-side time limit to help protect users who may step away from their computers. After a period of inactivity, the Web page asks if the user needs more time. If the user does not respond within 120 seconds, a timeout occurs. The user is able to request more time at least 10 times.</li>
						<li>A Web page has a section that automatically updates with the latest headlines in a rotating fashion. There is an interactive control that is easy to activate and is labeled with simple text. It allows the user to extend the length of time, between each update, to as much as ten times the default. The control can be operated by mouse, keyboard, or touch.</li>
						<li>A ticket-purchasing web site allows users two minutes to confirm purchase of selected seats, but warns users when their time is almost out. It allows users to extend this time limit at least 10 times using a simple action, which is labeled with simple text, such as a button labeled "Extend time limit".</li>
						<li>In an auction, there is a time limit on the amount of time a user has to submit a bid. Because the time limit applies to all users who want to bid on an item, it would be unfair to extend the time limit for one user. Therefore, a time limit is required for this type of activity. No extension, adjustment, or deactivation of such a time limit is required by this design requirement.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This pattern helps people with a variety of disabilities including the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>People with physical disabilities, who often need more time to react, to type, and to complete activities. - People with low vision need more time to locate things on screen, and to read. People who are blind, and who use screen readers, may need more time to understand screen layouts, to find information, and to operate controls. People, who have cognitive or language limitations, need more time to read and to understand. People who are deaf, and who communicate in sign language, may need more time to read textual information (which may be a second language for some).</li>
						<li>In circumstances where a sign-language interpreter may be relating audio content to a user who is deaf, control over time limits is also important.</li>
						<li>People with reading disabilities, cognitive limitations, and learning disabilities, who may need more time to read or to comprehend information, can pause content to have additional time to read it.</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Pattern: Provide feedback</h3>
				<p>For each step in a process let the user know of its status and if it was successfully completed.</p>
				<section>
					<h3>How it helps </h3>
					Making the result of each user action clear helps people with a variety of cognitive disabilities:
					<ul>
						<li>understand that their actions were processed (e.g., the click did something) </li>
						<li>prevent uncertainty or doubt regarding the outcome</li>
						<li>remember what they just did</li>
					</ul>
					<p>For example, a user with age appropriate forgetfulness, may have difficulty remembering how the interface worked. So when they press the send button that may not feel confident that the form was submitted. Feedback, such as a thank you message, will tell them and make them feel confident in the process.</p>
					<p>During a multi-step task this feedback (user-action feedback)  can also assist people, with attention or short-term cognitive disabilities remember what they are doing . For example, a user with early dementia may get distracted and then forget exactly were they were in the task. This user-action feedback helps re-orientate them. It also helps avoid them leaving a task by reminding them that they are in a process, and where in the process they currently are.</p>
					<p>Provide easily-recognizable success or failure feedback with every user action. When possible the feedback should use a consistent and familiar design patterns. For example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>After a step in a multi-step task is completed, breadcrumbs display a tick or a checkmark next to that step's name; and, if applicable, the title or the name of the next step is readily apparent.
						<li>After a button is clicked, it should look depressed. (Note that if it is a toggle button, the state should also be programmatically determinable).
						<li>After a form is submitted or an email message is sent, feedback communicating what just happened, such as "Your application was submitted, thank you" or "Your email message was sent" is provided.
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>More details</h3>
					<p>The success or failure of every user initiated action is clearly indicated to the user by visual, programmatically-determinable, rapid feedback in the primary modalities of the content. Audio feedback is supported.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Examples</h3>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>WAI-ARIA states are used to provide state feedback for a toggle button with an animation showing the state (such as a button was pushed )</li>
						<li>Use ARIA-pressed with a visual or a checkbox is checked/unchecked</li>
						<li>Provide a confirmation message when an email message is successfully sent, or a form is successfully submitted</li>
						<li>Provide visible and programmatically-determinable information to indicate a new password satisfies security requirements</li>
					</ul>>
					<p><strong>Failure </strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>There is no progress-indicator (e.g., breadcrumbs) to communicate completed and current steps in a multi-step process</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Pattern: Tell the users about fees and charges at the beginning of a task</h3>
				<p>Tell the user about all charges at the start of a transaction including typical values. Any conditions and terms should also be available at the start of the transaction in easy language.</p>
				<section>
					<h3>How it helps </h3>
					<p>Users with cognitive disabilities who have trouble with memory, attention to detail or reading comprehension may not be aware of charges unless they are explicitly noted at the start of a transaction task. Terms and conditions can be under a link but charges must be clearly displayed and available in plain language.</p>
					<p>Clearly identifying charges at the start of a sale benefits all users. Those with cognitive disabilities will particularly benefit because some groups are less likely to have inferred or guessed the charges would be included.  They may not know to look in other locations in the user flow or in another location, for example on the homepage, or on a rates page.</p>
					<p>People with impaired Executive Function or memory need to have all the consequences presented in an orderly form to be able to make an informed decision. When charges are not clear, the consent of the transaction is unclear.</p>
					<p>It also can take much longer for users with disabilities to go through the process of making a purchase. If a person has spent hours making an online purchase, it is much more difficult and upsetting to find out that they cannot afford it. They will often blame themselves for not understanding the price and may experience a loss of confidence. They may stop trusting themselves for day-to-day activities.</p>
					<p>For example a person with Executive Function challenges may be trying to order a plane ticket, and not realize that there are extra fees not quoted in the original price, such as taxes, international fees, baggage fees, etc. They may spend hours booking a holiday only to find that they can’t afford it. Or, they end up purchasing something they cannot afford. And even if they have completed this process in the past, they are not able to bring their experience into future purchases to anticipate the final price. The result is the user loses confidence in their ability to independently purchase a holiday online, may have incurred a debt they are unable to pay, may not attempt again, or only with the help of a hired professional (e.g. travel agent or assistant).</p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Examples</h3>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> examples</p>
					<ul>

				<h3>Pattern: The user knows when the content changes</h3>
				<p class="ednote">This is missing from the google doc, though Rachael is marked as having reviewed. Text here is the original doc contents. Needs examples and technical resources.</p>
				<p>Ensure that changes of context, functionality, settings, route and orientation are initiated only by user request or an easily available mechanism is available to turn off such changes. An easily available mechanism is also available to go to previous context, functionality, settings, route and orientation.</p>
				<section>
					<h3>How it helps </h3>
					<p>Any content, settings or functionality which changes unexpectedly, without user initiation can result in significant barriers for users with cognitive disabilities. Unexpected changes in any of these areas can result in loss of focus, anxiety, or confusion in understanding or using a user interface (such as menus, buttons and design components). Examples include but are not limited to:</p>
					<ul>
						</li>Automatic launching of new windows or pop-ups</li>
						<li>Submission of forms through mechanisms other than a button that is clearly labelled using simple language to submit the form</li>
						<li>Rerouting automatically by a GPS</li>
						<li>Changing the direction of a map in a GPS</li>
					</ul>
					<p>For example, a user may not have a sense of direction or know their left and right. Before using a GPS they may study the route so that they know approximately what they are doing and can augment the directions of the GPS with their own context, using the GPS for cues. The GPS automatically reroutes them because of a small traffic delay. They become completely lost and disorientated and can no longer use the application.</p>
					<p>This give users with cognitive disabilities more control over how Websites and applications behave and display information giving them the opportunity to make choices that enable them to use the content and complete the task.</p>

				<h3>Pattern: Keep the user information safe</h3>
				Keep the user's information safe. This includes:
				<ul>
					<li>Checking how safety and security techniques work with a wide range of customized profile including aging, learning and cognitive disabilities.</li>
					<li>Using known techniques to keep sensitive user information safe.</li>
					<li>Ensuring all users understand known risk.</li>
				</ul>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>It is vital that users stay safe on the internet. Information which suggests a user has Dementia or an intellectual disability allows predatory companies and individuals to target that user for scams or other risky activity. For example, a predatory company could send requests for money, saying “you haven’t made your donation” despite the user having made one. Avoid storing information that implies this or, if you do store it, provide strong security for that information.</p>
					<p>Users with weak executive functioning are less likely to identify risks correctly so clearly identifying potential risks helps the user stay safe. Add helpful tips for staying safe while using your content and provide help in case of problems.</p>
					<p>To help identify risks, we suggest holding research and focus groups with people with cognitive and learning disabilities and to work with people with disabilities to solve potential and existing problems.</p>
					<p>For example, many people who can not copy and paste passwords or use two-step authorization codes ask a caregiver to help them. As caregivers are often just temporary employees, this leaves the user completely exposed. Making passwords longer or requiring users change them regularly increases these unsafe practices and actually makes the application less secure for many people. This type of design error is common because people with cognitive and learning disabilities are left out of the user research and analysis.</p>
