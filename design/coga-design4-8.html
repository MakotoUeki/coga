			<h1>Introduction</h1>

			<p>Making websites and applications that are friendly for people with cognitive impairments affects every part of design and development.</p>
			<p>Traditionally accessibility has been most focused on the interface, and making that usable for people with sensory and physical impairments in vision, hearing and/or mobility. Some accessibility features will help people with cognitive impairments, but often the issues are about context, language, usability, and other more general factors that impact everyone to some degree.</p>
			<p>This document aims to provide guidance on how to make websites and applications that are friendly for people with cognitive impairments by providing guidance for your designs, and design process.</p>
			<p>This guide is divided into design themes. There are also user stories, testing methodologies, and design checkpoints for each theme. Just understanding the themes and user stories may help make your content more accessible to some users with cognitive and learning disabilities. Please see the section on user testing for guidance on how to perform COGA user testing.</p>
			<p class="ednote">This is an early draft. We expect many editorial changes to make the content more clear and easy to understand. We will also change the format along the lines of https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/</p>
			<p class="ednote">TODO Objective 1 - 3 sections go here</p>
		</section>

		<section id="objective-4">
			<h2>Objective: Prevent the user from making mistakes and make it easy to correct mistakes when they do occur.</h2>
			<p>A good design and use of scripts will make errors less likely, but when they do occur the user should know how to correct them easily without stess or extra steps.</p>
			<p>Completing forms and similar tasks is often overwhelming for most users with cognitive and learning disabilities. This includes relatively minor learning disabilities, such as Dyslexia, or attention related disabilities. </p>
			<p>Many users with learning disabilities cannot remember numbers, such as those for their post/zip code, Social Security, or credit card. Many users even need to check their phone numbers. This makes entering information slow, and they may need to leave their desks or take breaks. </p>
			<p>Also many users have short term memory issues that can make copying text difficult or impossible. For example, if you can remember 7 letters in your head at the same time. They may be able to remember one or two. This makes them much more likely to make mistakes copying as it requires you to remember the numbers or letter accurately.</p>
			<p>Note that a lot can be achieved through supporting personalization.</p>
			<section>
				<h3>User testing</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Can they easily fill in the form without making mistakes?</li>
					<li>Was it pleasant to fill out the form? How is their mood changed?</li>
					<li>Ask the users if they would find this easy to do if under stress or tiered?</li>
					<li>Ask the user if anything was hard.</li>
					<li>Ask the user how the form could be easier to fill out. Suggest some of the relevant design techniques bellow and ask if it would help them with this form </li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>User stories</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>As a user who needs to look up my postal/zip code, I do not want a session to time out while I try to find the information needed.</li>
					<li>As a user who needs to take breaks during tasks, such as completing a form, I want to be sure all my work is saved automatically if my computer crashes. I do not want to have to start over again, which can create a cycle of reentering my data; and making me more tired and more likely to make mistakes.</li>
					<li>As a user with difficulty typing numbers in the right order, I want an interface that makes mistakes less likely.</li>
					<li>As a user who finds entering information stressful, I want to enter as little information as I can so the task is more manageable.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Pattern: Build forms so that people make less mistakes</h3>
				<ul>
					<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#input-errordef">Input errors</a> should be automatic corrected (where the correction is reliable) if suggestions for corrections are known, the suggestions are provided to the user</p><li>In a text field, accept as many formats as possible. For example accept different formats of  phone numbers and correct <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#input-errordef">Input errors</a> automatically</li>
					<li>Use an interface were only valid  input can be selected</li>
					<li>Accept voice prompts for people with a speech impairment</li>
					<li>Use the default format of the users  location such as currency and temperature </li>
					<li>Use autocomplete and personalization of form controls</li>
				</ul>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>People with cognitive or learning disabilities and aging users often abandon tasks and believe they cannot complete them if they receive too many errors. Error messages may be confusing.  Correcting errors is often difficult and frustrating for the user. Many users give up when they get successive errors</p>
					<p>For example, while registering for an online banking account a form requires the input of the user's birthdate. The required input format is xx/xx/xxxx with a leading zero for single digits. If a single input field with no input correction is presented, a user with a cognitive disability may enter 1/3/1996 thus triggering an error notification. It may not be clear to the user that the required format is 01/03/1996 even if an example for instance, xx/xx/xxxx, is shown below the input field or in the error notification. </p>
					<p>However a well designed form will make it easier to fill in the information and prevent the user from making mistakes.</p>
					<p>Image of options being restricted to valid inputs</p>
					<!-- <div>
						<img alt="Image of options being restricted to valid inputs" src="img/restricted-to-valid-inputs.png" width="200" height="150">
					</div> -->
					<p>Autocomplete </p>
					<!-- <div>
						<img alt="Autocomplete" src="img/site-using-autocomplete.png" height="500" width="600">
					</div> -->
					<p>Minimizing user generated errors by automatically correcting them will also minimize error notifications. Error notifications may be distracting taking focus away from tasks and task completion. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Only correct errors if the correction is reliable. Otherwise, if suggestions for corrections are known, give the suggestions to the user. 
							<ul>
								<li>For example, “did you mean the first of February (01/02) or the second of January (02/01)</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Calendars and dates
							<ul>
								<li>Calendars should default to the first relevant day. Work calendars should default to first working day of a user's locale.</li>
								<li>Calendar based booking systems must avoid ability to book return date before departure date.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Temperature
							<ul>
								</li>Use the default temperature format of location. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Success </strong>Example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Correct errors of the post code being written in the text field with the city or state information</li>
						<li>User is unable to select inappropriate dates and a simple explanation provided should he/she try to do so.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Failure </strong>Examples:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The booking form provides two calendars without clear labels and instruction and user is able to select dates without warning as to whether they are possible e.g. flight out on June 1st - flight return May 30th</li>
						<li>User can select inappropriate dates without warning. Calendar merely grays out inappropriate dates which may not be noticed. No warnings provided.</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Pattern: Make it easy to undo errors</h3>
				<p>Allow the user to check their work before submitting a form so that they can correct any mistakes.Once they have fixed their mistake it should be easy to get back to the place they were at (without redoing extra steps).</p>
				<p><strong>For financial transactions and important information: </strong>Allow the user to easily cancel the transactions and provide simple instructions including the amount of time the user has to cancel a transaction.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>People with cognitive and learning impairments make many more mistakes in filling out forms than the general population. When mistakes cannot be easily corrected they can not complete the task.</p>
					<p>This helps people with cognitive disabilities for safely using forms and reduces the consequences that are the result of a mistake.</p>
					<p>For example, a user with a memory impairment may not remember that they have already added an item to their shopping cart and may add the item a second time. They may confused the dates when booking a trip, and many other mistakes. </p>
					<p>It is essential that people with cognitive impairments have the opportunity to check their work AND can fix their mistakes easily.</p>
					<p>For people with cognitive disabilities, mistakes being theoretically reversible is not enough. Often the process of reversing a transaction is too complex for them to manage without help. They may not have access to that help meaning they have to live with all the mistakes they have made. For example, when inputting credit card information incorrectly these mistakes can be devastating. In addition if the process of correcting mistakes is too difficult, users may give up, either losing the transaction or buying unwanted items because of the one required item.</p>
					<p>The effect of this happening multiple times is devastating and can result in a large number of users with disabilities stopping to use the Internet for many tasks.</p>
					<p>Allowing the user to change the number of items in the shopping cart at any time can significantly reduce the chances of these mistakes. </p>
					<p>A summary of the order, including product quantities and other costs before the final submission, gives the user the chance to identify any errors and make changes to the order.In this example given, a summary of the purchase helps the user  see the error in quantity as well as a higher than expected order total.</p>
					<p> In some cases a user may realize that a mistake has been made after the final submission of data. Simple language instructions on how to cancel transactions and  helping  the user understanding the amount of time the user has to cancel a transaction and makes them less susceptible to scams</p>
					<p>In another example, a user with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder purchasing a travel ticket on a website may struggle with details and may have a low attention span. The successful completion of the order relies on the information provided at multiple steps in the process.An error due to lack of accuracy or attention to detail such as an incorrect street number or zip code in the billing address will result in the order not going though. If a summary is not provided before submitting the final order or is not clear the user may not understand the reason for the declined payment and give up on the order. The user may also give up if there is not an easy way to make correction, and all the order needs to be redone.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<p>This typically includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Change: It is simple for the user to review all the data and correct mistakes, including mistakes that might not be automatically identified. The user can change information via clearly labeled actions and get back to the place they were at, in one clearly labeled action without unwanted loss of data. (Some data may need to be entered if it is dependent on the item that was changed.)</li>
						<li>Confirmed: A summary is provided before submitting important information and the user is told when they are about to submit the final information.</li>
						<li>Time frames and instruction for cancelling transactions are clear and easy to follow.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Getting started</h4>
					<p>Start with forms were a mistake can have serious consequences such as financial loss or vulnerability.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples </h4>
					<p><strong>Success </strong>examples:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Provide a summary before submitting important information. Make it clearly labelled to repair information and one click to return to the summary</li>
						<li>Provide clickable breadcrumbs that allow users to see the previous steps, go back, and change them</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Failure </strong>examples:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Provide a summary before submitting important information. But it is hard to repair the information</li>
						<li>Provide a summary before submitting important information. But then you have to redo a lot of other non-dependent information </li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Pattern: Use clear labels and instructions</h3>
				<p>Provide clear instructions up front when appropriate that is clear, concise, and accessible. Ensure labels are also clear.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps </h4>
					<p>Clear instructions help prevent user errors up front. This reduces frustration and enhances the user’s autonomy and independence because they can avoid asking for help. This helps anybody with memory issues, people new to culture, people on autism spectrum who may miss cultural context.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details [optional]</h4>
					<p>Provide instructions at the start of the process, not simply in an error message.</p>

					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Provide an image of a passport with the number highlighted to indicate where the number is that the user should enter.</li>
						<li>Explicitly say which day of the week is the start (e.g., Sunday or Monday) in calendar control when booking a hotel.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Failure </strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Request a passport number, but the passport may have several numbers and the user is uncertain which is requested.</li>
						<li>Site does not clarify start of week, and user reads calendar control wrong and books hotel for wrong day.</li>

				<h3>Pattern: Provide flexibility in form inputs</h3>
				<p class="ednote">This is a new Pattern added by Gareth, Jamie, Michael during the face to face. It was inspied by "Use clear labels and instructions"</p>
				<p>Be forgiving of contextual variations in user input such as currency, time zone, and locale.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps </h4>
					<p>Forgiving form entry processes help prevent user errors up front. This reduces frustration and enhances the user’s autonomy and independence because they can avoid asking for help. This helps anybody with memory issues, people new to culture, people on the autism spectrum who may miss cultural context.</p>

					<h4>Getting started [optional]</h4>
					<p>For inputs that collect known data types, such as credit card or telephone numbers or geography names, accept common variations on the input format so users don’t have to convert or receive avoidable error messages.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>User inputting a financial value can specify the currency used, even if different from the site’s.</li>
						<li>User inputs a credit card number with or without spaces, and the information is accepted.</li>
						<li>User inputs telephone number as written including country code, region code, and number using brackets.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Failure </strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>User inputs value thinking it is US dollars, but the web site processes in Euros.</li>
						<li>User inputs credit number with spaces only to be told it must include numbers only.</li>
						<li>User inputs telephone number but is told it must include numbers only.</li>

				<h3>Pattern: Avoid data loss and "time outs"</h3>
				<p class="ednote">This needs reworking, including extracting the examples from the text</p>
				<p>Avoid timeouts. When this is not possible, inform user of the amount of time required to complete the process (before timeout) and if user will lose entered data if a timeout occurs. </p>
				<section>
					<h3>How it helps </h3>
					<p>The use of timed events can present significant barriers for users with cognitive disabilities, as these users may require more time to read content or to perform functions, such as completing an online form.</p>
					<p>During the completion of an online process for reserving a hotel room and purchasing a plane ticket, a user with a cognitive impairment may become overwhelmed with the amount of instruction and data input required to complete the process. The user may not be able to complete the process in one sitting, and may need to take a break. Users should be able to leave a process without losing their current place within the process, and without losing data that have already been entered. If users cannot take a break and check their work, many will often be unable to complete a task correctly.</p>
					<p>While making a purchase on an e-commerce Web site, a user with a cognitive disability may not remember required information (e.g., a phone number or a zip code) that may seem easy to remember for users without a cognitive impairment. Users with cognitive disabilities may need additional time to look up the information required to complete a transaction, without losing their place in the process, and without losing data that have already been entered.</p>
					<p>In another example, users’ cognitive skills may temporarily diminish as they get tired. They then must stop the task for that day, and continue it when they are feeling better, and when their reading or processing skills are back to their higher levels.</p>
					<p>For situations where the absence of a timed event would significantly change the intended functionality of an application (e.g., an auction or another real-time event), it is important to ensure that users with disabilities are properly notified. Notifications should include information about timed events, and an indication of the duration of the time given. As well, they should include mechanisms clearly labelled to adjust, extend, or stop the duration of an event, to allow users to fully engage and interact with Web content and functionality. For example, if an e-commerce Web site's checkout process provides secure credit card transactions, the user is notified of the timeout, and is given at least 120 seconds to extend it.</p>
					<p>These experiences have been reported by members of the task force who have various cognitive impairments. There is significant user research indicating that timed events rarely help anyone; and can cause stress and frustration.</p>
					<p>It should be noted that many users, within 20 seconds, cannot read instructions to extend a time limit. We thus extended the time limit to 120 seconds.</p>
					<p>We also require simple text conforming to the understandable language design requirement.</p>
					<p>This helps users who need additional time performing tasks or reading content. This can include the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A Web site uses a client-side time limit to help protect users who may step away from their computers. After a period of inactivity, the Web page asks if the user needs more time. If the user does not respond within 120 seconds, a timeout occurs. The user is able to request more time at least 10 times.</li>
						<li>A Web page has a section that automatically updates with the latest headlines in a rotating fashion. There is an interactive control that is easy to activate and is labeled with simple text. It allows the user to extend the length of time, between each update, to as much as ten times the default. The control can be operated by mouse, keyboard, or touch.</li>
						<li>A ticket-purchasing web site allows users two minutes to confirm purchase of selected seats, but warns users when their time is almost out. It allows users to extend this time limit at least 10 times using a simple action, which is labeled with simple text, such as a button labeled "Extend time limit".</li>
						<li>In an auction, there is a time limit on the amount of time a user has to submit a bid. Because the time limit applies to all users who want to bid on an item, it would be unfair to extend the time limit for one user. Therefore, a time limit is required for this type of activity. No extension, adjustment, or deactivation of such a time limit is required by this design requirement.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This pattern helps people with a variety of disabilities including the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>People with physical disabilities, who often need more time to react, to type, and to complete activities. - People with low vision need more time to locate things on screen, and to read. People who are blind, and who use screen readers, may need more time to understand screen layouts, to find information, and to operate controls. People, who have cognitive or language limitations, need more time to read and to understand. People who are deaf, and who communicate in sign language, may need more time to read textual information (which may be a second language for some).</li>
						<li>In circumstances where a sign-language interpreter may be relating audio content to a user who is deaf, control over time limits is also important.</li>
						<li>People with reading disabilities, cognitive limitations, and learning disabilities, who may need more time to read or to comprehend information, can pause content to have additional time to read it.</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Pattern: Provide feedback</h3>
				<p>For each step in a process let the user know of its status and if it was successfully completed.</p>
				<section>
					<h3>How it helps </h3>
					Making the result of each user action clear helps people with a variety of cognitive disabilities:
					<ul>
						<li>understand that their actions were processed (e.g., the click did something) </li>
						<li>prevent uncertainty or doubt regarding the outcome</li>
						<li>remember what they just did</li>
					</ul>
					<p>For example, a user with age appropriate forgetfulness, may have difficulty remembering how the interface worked. So when they press the send button that may not feel confident that the form was submitted. Feedback, such as a thank you message, will tell them and make them feel confident in the process.</p>
					<p>During a multi-step task this feedback (user-action feedback)  can also assist people, with attention or short-term cognitive disabilities remember what they are doing . For example, a user with early dementia may get distracted and then forget exactly were they were in the task. This user-action feedback helps re-orientate them. It also helps avoid them leaving a task by reminding them that they are in a process, and where in the process they currently are.</p>
					<p>Provide easily-recognizable success or failure feedback with every user action. When possible the feedback should use a consistent and familiar design patterns. For example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>After a step in a multi-step task is completed, breadcrumbs display a tick or a checkmark next to that step's name; and, if applicable, the title or the name of the next step is readily apparent.
						<li>After a button is clicked, it should look depressed. (Note that if it is a toggle button, the state should also be programmatically determinable).
						<li>After a form is submitted or an email message is sent, feedback communicating what just happened, such as "Your application was submitted, thank you" or "Your email message was sent" is provided.
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>More details</h3>
					<p>The success or failure of every user initiated action is clearly indicated to the user by visual, programmatically-determinable, rapid feedback in the primary modalities of the content. Audio feedback is supported.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Examples</h3>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>WAI-ARIA states are used to provide state feedback for a toggle button with an animation showing the state (such as a button was pushed )</li>
						<li>Use ARIA-pressed with a visual or a checkbox is checked/unchecked</li>
						<li>Provide a confirmation message when an email message is successfully sent, or a form is successfully submitted</li>
						<li>Provide visible and programmatically-determinable information to indicate a new password satisfies security requirements</li>
					</ul>>
					<p><strong>Failure </strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>There is no progress-indicator (e.g., breadcrumbs) to communicate completed and current steps in a multi-step process</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Pattern: Tell the users about fees and charges at the beginning of a task</h3>
				<p>Tell the user about all charges at the start of a transaction including typical values. Any conditions and terms should also be available at the start of the transaction in easy language.</p>
				<section>
					<h3>How it helps </h3>
					<p>Users with cognitive disabilities who have trouble with memory, attention to detail or reading comprehension may not be aware of charges unless they are explicitly noted at the start of a transaction task. Terms and conditions can be under a link but charges must be clearly displayed and available in plain language.</p>
					<p>Clearly identifying charges at the start of a sale benefits all users. Those with cognitive disabilities will particularly benefit because some groups are less likely to have inferred or guessed the charges would be included.  They may not know to look in other locations in the user flow or in another location, for example on the homepage, or on a rates page.</p>
					<p>People with impaired Executive Function or memory need to have all the consequences presented in an orderly form to be able to make an informed decision. When charges are not clear, the consent of the transaction is unclear.</p>
					<p>It also can take much longer for users with disabilities to go through the process of making a purchase. If a person has spent hours making an online purchase, it is much more difficult and upsetting to find out that they cannot afford it. They will often blame themselves for not understanding the price and may experience a loss of confidence. They may stop trusting themselves for day-to-day activities.</p>
					<p>For example a person with Executive Function challenges may be trying to order a plane ticket, and not realize that there are extra fees not quoted in the original price, such as taxes, international fees, baggage fees, etc. They may spend hours booking a holiday only to find that they can’t afford it. Or, they end up purchasing something they cannot afford. And even if they have completed this process in the past, they are not able to bring their experience into future purchases to anticipate the final price. The result is the user loses confidence in their ability to independently purchase a holiday online, may have incurred a debt they are unable to pay, may not attempt again, or only with the help of a hired professional (e.g. travel agent or assistant).</p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Examples</h3>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>There are no surprise charges or conditions.</li>
						<li>Users are aware of all charges (including hidden fees) and can make an informed decision when they decide to purchase an item and put it in a shopping cart.</li>
						<li>For items that shipping charges vary, the range of shipping charges and the issues that change the rate would be listed, along with a link to where more details can be found. For example, weight and speed of shipping my impact your shipping fees which can be between $4 and $400 depending on location.</li>
					</ul>>
					<p><strong>Failure </strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Final transaction includes unknown charges that result in higher-than-expected total charges.</li>
						<li>Final transactions include conditions of purchase that are not clear to users from the beginning of the task.</li>
						<li>Transactions contain charges or conditions that the user did not know about until they have invested a lot of effort into the sale.<li>
						<li>Final transaction is completed and users are surprised by the total they receive.</li>

				<h3>Pattern: The user knows when the content changes</h3>
				<p class="ednote">This is missing from the google doc, though Rachael is marked as having reviewed. Text here is the original doc contents. Needs examples and technical resources.</p>
				<p>Ensure that changes of context, functionality, settings, route and orientation are initiated only by user request or an easily available mechanism is available to turn off such changes. An easily available mechanism is also available to go to previous context, functionality, settings, route and orientation.</p>
				<section>
					<h3>How it helps </h3>
					<p>Any content, settings or functionality which changes unexpectedly, without user initiation can result in significant barriers for users with cognitive disabilities. Unexpected changes in any of these areas can result in loss of focus, anxiety, or confusion in understanding or using a user interface (such as menus, buttons and design components). Examples include but are not limited to:</p>
					<ul>
						</li>Automatic launching of new windows or pop-ups</li>
						<li>Submission of forms through mechanisms other than a button that is clearly labelled using simple language to submit the form</li>
						<li>Rerouting automatically by a GPS</li>
						<li>Changing the direction of a map in a GPS</li>
					</ul>
					<p>For example, a user may not have a sense of direction or know their left and right. Before using a GPS they may study the route so that they know approximately what they are doing and can augment the directions of the GPS with their own context, using the GPS for cues. The GPS automatically reroutes them because of a small traffic delay. They become completely lost and disorientated and can no longer use the application.</p>
					<p>This give users with cognitive disabilities more control over how Websites and applications behave and display information giving them the opportunity to make choices that enable them to use the content and complete the task.</p>

				<h3>Pattern: Keep the user information safe</h3>
				<p>Keep the user's information safe. This includes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Checking how safety and security techniques work with a wide range of customized profile including aging, learning and cognitive disabilities.</li>
					<li>Using known techniques to keep sensitive user information safe.</li>
					<li>Ensuring all users understand known risk.</li>
				</ul>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>It is vital that users stay safe on the internet. Information which suggests a user has Dementia or an intellectual disability allows predatory companies and individuals to target that user for scams or other risky activity. For example, a predatory company could send requests for money, saying “you haven’t made your donation” despite the user having made one. Avoid storing information that implies this or, if you do store it, provide strong security for that information.</p>
					<p>Users with weak executive functioning are less likely to identify risks correctly so clearly identifying potential risks helps the user stay safe. Add helpful tips for staying safe while using your content and provide help in case of problems.</p>
					<p>To help identify risks, we suggest holding research and focus groups with people with cognitive and learning disabilities and to work with people with disabilities to solve potential and existing problems.</p>
					<p>For example, many people who can not copy and paste passwords or use two-step authorization codes ask a caregiver to help them. As caregivers are often just temporary employees, this leaves the user completely exposed. Making passwords longer or requiring users change them regularly increases these unsafe practices and actually makes the application less secure for many people. This type of design error is common because people with cognitive and learning disabilities are left out of the user research and analysis.</p>

			<h2>Objective: Help the user focus and restore context if attention is lost.</h2>
			<p>Distractions can cause users with cognitive disabilities problems such as: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>They can lose focus on the current action; </li>
				<li>draw attention away from the task they are trying to do; and </li>
				<li>can be difficult for some users to know how to understand, avoid, and/or stop them.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once users become distracted, it can be <strong>difficult for them to remember what they were doing</strong>. Then they can no longer complete their task at all.  This is especially problematic for users with both low attention and impaired memory, such as users with dementia.</p>
			<p>Items like bread crumbs can help orientate the user and help the user restore the context when it is lost. (Making breadcrumbs clickable can also help the user undo mistakes.)</p>
			<section>
				<h3>User testing </h3>
				<p>Make sure your user testing has all the different cognitive disabilities represented. Test for the following:</p>
				<p>Identify the different tasks:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Can they achieve the activities easily without losing focus?</li>
					<li>Distract the user for a minute so that they lose focus. Can they get easily back to the task?</li>
					<li>Ask the users if they would find this easy to do if under stress or tiered </li>
					<li>Ask the user what would help them remember what they are doing such as headers or breadcrumbs.</li>
					<li>Ask the user if anything was distracting.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>User stories</h3>
				<p>As a user who is easily distracted I need less distractions from my task.</p>
				<p>As a user with a poor memory I need easy sign posts about what is on the screen, where I am in a process and what i am doing, incase I get distracted in the middle of a task.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Pattern: Avoid interruptions</h3>
				<p>If you can not avoid them, make an easy way to delay and control interruptions and changes in content, unless they are started by the user or involve an emergency.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>For people with memory or attention challenges, interruptions can make completing a task very difficult or impossible. This can include individuals with Dementia, those that have had a stroke or brain injury, and those taking medications with side effects impacting memory and/or attention. Certain types of interruptions or a certain number may cause them to give up, even if the task is very important. Interruptions can include sounds, content that visually appears or changes (e.g. ads on a page). It can be as simple as text notifications about the presence of new changes while working in a shared online document.</p>
					<p>A site will work best for those with memory or attention challenges if they:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Have no interruptions at all,</li>
						<li>Have an easy to use pause option so interruptions can be viewed later, or</li>
						<li>Have a setting where users can select which types of interruptions they prefer.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Many news websites have a lot of interruptions that can cause challenges for people needing to read important information, such as school closures due to bad weather. They may encounter breaking news text, advertisements, and pop-up windows. For those with difficulty focusing and sifting through the school names, or have two or three they need to check, these distractions may make the task impossible. By letting the user pause these distractions, and ideally temporarily remove them from the page, they will better be able to complete the task. </p>
					<p>Where standard techniques exists for the above, they should be used.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
						<p><strong>Success</strong> examples</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Microsoft Office 365 lets the user decide how they want to be notified about reminders and emails. Users can choose visual reminders and/or sounds, or none. For some users, not having any notifications enables them to focus on a task and then go to their emails or calendar when the task is completed.</li>
						</ul>>
						<p><strong>Failure </strong> examples</p>
						<ul>
							<li>There are advertisements on a Magazine article pages that interrupt a reader’s focus. In the example below, the ad just under the banner changes (black oval) and the ad below the first article photo (navy rectangle) change every 20 seconds. </li>

				<h3>Pattern: Avoid too much content on the page.</h3>
				<p>Provide users with less than five choices on each screen. This can be a simplified version or have extra choices linked from clear and descriptive titles.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>Too much text, too many images and too much other content can cause overload, anxiety and distraction.  Keeping content down to a small number of important points reduces the clutter, calms the mind and allows for better understanding whilst aiding memory.  In particular, it helps those with a short attention span who will leave the page if it appears complex.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
						<h4>More details</h4>
						<p>Avoiding long paragraphs and non-meaningful imagery ensures those with cognitive impairments can concentrate on the important points being made. </p>
						<p>Keeping to a few short bullet points and limiting to one or two images related to the main subject areas of a website or service allows the user to choose whether to explore the site further.</p>
					</section>
				<section>
						<p><strong>Success</strong> examples</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Google has one of the simplest yet easiest sites to use and this has been copied by companies such as trivago with a simple search box and some clear statements followed by some meaningful images as links to other pages</li>
						</ul>>
						<p><strong>Failure </strong> examples</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A page with too much content, long menus and images set around long paragraphs of dense text does not help anyone but more importantly the message is lost in an overload of information</li>
						</ul>

					<h4>Technical details</h4>
					<p>[WCAG SC 3.3.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/minimize-error-cues.html)</p>
					<p>"The intent of this Success Criterion is not to clutter the page with unnecessary information but to provide important cues and instructions that will benefit people with disabilities. Too much information or instruction can be just as much of a hindrance as too little. The goal is to make certain that enough information is provided for the user to accomplish the task without undue confusion or navigation."			</p>

			<h2>Objective: Processes do not rely on memory.</h2>
			<p class="ednote">This has been renamed form "Avoid barriers" and the text needs a review.</p>
			<p>Do not put barriers that stop people with cognitive disabilities from using or getting to content. </p>
			<p>Many users have memory issues and/or language issues that can make remembering passwords or remembering numbers, while processing words, difficult or impossible. That can make transcribing text or remembering passwords difficult or impossible.</p>
			<p>Sometimes security and authentication put a barrier between users and the tasks they are doing. For example, requiring remembering and/or transcribing passwords often blocks users with cognitive disabilities from accessing content or using a service.</p>
			<p>Sometimes developers put a menu barrier between users and the task they are doing so users cannot use the content or service.</p>
			<p>Voice XML enables voice dialog systems and voice browsers. An example might be a phone menu system that ask you “dial 1 for internal services, dial 2 for external services, .dial 9 for billing services “. Sometimes users need to hold multiple pieces of transitory information in their minds, such as a number being presented as an option, while processing terms that follow. Many people with impaired short term memory can not hold more than two or three pieces of information in their  at the same time so they can not do this task and can not get to the place they need to be. </p>
			<p>When possible, provide easy-to-use options.</p>
			<p>Note that a lot can be achieved through supporting personalization.</p>

				<h3>User testing</h3>
				<p>Make sure your user testing has all the different cognitive disabilities represented. Test for the following:</p>
				<p>Identify the different activities that the user may want to complete on the page:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Can they achieve the activities without asking for help </li>
					<li>Does the user make errors trying to achieve the activities</li>
					<li>Does the user find the activities easy to achieve</li>
					<li>Can the user do the same thing later (the password may have been forgotten)</li>
					<li>Ask the users if they would find this easy to do if under stress or tiered </li>
					<li>Ask the user were they might have trouble if they are under stress</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>User stories</h3>
				<p>This leads to the following user stories for logging in:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>As a user who has memory impairments and often forgets passwords, I need to be able to use a site, without remembering or transcribing passwords and user names, so I can use its service.</li>
					<li>As a user who has impairments, I need to use a site without being required to transcribe items in the correct sequence.</li>
					<li>As a user who has weak executive function, I need the login process to be simple, and not multi-step, so I can use it.</li>
					<li>As a symbol user, I need a login process I can use.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This leads to the following user stories for voice menus:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>As a user who has memory impairments and weak language processing skills, I want to get help, without going through a Voice-ML menu system, so I can set an appointment or find out some information.</li>
					<li>As a user who has weak executive function, I need a process to get help to be simple, and not multi-step, so I can use it.</li>
					<li>Users can have trouble identifying the right words to say in a voice menu.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Pattern: Logging in does not rely on good memory or other cognitive skills</h3>
				<p>Users can login and register without having more cognitive abilities then they need to use a simple web page. This includes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>memorizing character strings,</li>
					<li>perform calculations, or</li>
					<li>coping; or</li>
					<li>Answer puzzles; or </li>
					<li>reliably produce gestures; or</li>
					<li>recognize characters presented on screen, and then enter them into an input field.</li>
				</ul>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>Many people with week memory often lose the password and not be able to login and use their applications. Their solutions often are only sometimes helpful and have security risks:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>may have to look at or listen to text several times to copy or type it into a form field;</li>
						<li>may reuse a single passwords; or a simple-to-remember passwords, which they can remember. This is a security risk</li>
						<li>If they need to change their password or use a complicated password they may keep passwords insecurely, such as written on pieces of paper which people can see.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The may also struggle with other steps of login</p>
					<ul>
						<li>enter characters in the correct order;</li>
						<li>enter characters correctly on the first try (resulting in being locked out).Some people with cognitive disabilities may not be able to:</li>
						<li>find a PIN;</li>
						<li>work out puzzles or distorted letters
							<!-- <div>
								<img alt="puzzles or distorted letters" src="puzzles-distorted-letters.gif" height="200" width="300">
							</div> -->
						</li>
						<li>They can also give up after getting frustrated with time-limited procedures or presentations of digital security tokens;</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Without this design requirement, many people cannot use an application or content at all. See <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/issue-papers/privacy-security.html">Security and Privacy Technologies</a> issue paper for the full description of this issue, and how it stops people from using web services that are often critical. Many people cannot make doctors’ appointments, etc., by themselves. This may be partly responsible for the reduced life expectancy of people with learning and cognitive disabilities.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<p>There are many ways to meet this design guidance item.  </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/">Web Authentication: An API for accessing Public Key Credentials</a></li>
						<li>Automatic user authentication based upon the use of a trusted device (to which the user has already logged in with their own identity);</li>
						<li>Biometrics </li>
						<li>being already logged in to third-party authentication services (e.g., OAuth, Facebook, etc.).</li>
						<li>Methods of meeting requirements for alternative user authentication would include:
							<ul>
								<li>Clicking a link sent to an email address or a phone number; (Note that this is easy to implement and may be useful for minimal security, such as allowing comments on a blog)</li>
								<li>Logging in by using information present in users' personal documentation, such as the total number of a current account balance, with explanation on how to find this information.</li>

				<h3>Pattern: Let people avoid navigating voice menus.</h3>
				<p class="ednote">This should probably be reworded as voice menus have very little to do with Web UIs. Perhaps merge with provide help?</p>
				<p>Let people easily reach an operator without going through multiple steps.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>Many people cannot use voice menu systems and other complex systems. This often stops people from critical tasks by themselves. Often this can include: making doctors' appointments, getting health insurance, reaching social services, get their water turned back on, etc.. </p>
					<p>If people can not manage menus by themselves they have to ask someone else to help them. For example they may delay making a doctor’s appointment or other critical task as not to bother their helper. This is a huge problem and means people often do not get the help they need or get it too late. This may be partly responsible for the lower life expectancy of people with learning and cognitive disabilities.</p>
					<p>See <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/issue-papers/voice-menus.html">Voice Menu Systems</a>issue paper for a full discussion. </p>
					<p><strong>Why can’t people use complex menus?</strong></p>
					<p>A good short term memory (several seconds) is essential so that the user can remember the number or the term for the menu. Without these functions the user is likely to select the wrong number.  </p>
					<p>Many users have a small short term memory. For example, if you can remember 7 letters or items in your head at the same time they may be able to remember one or two. This makes them less likely to manage a menu system correctly. For example a phone menu system (voice ML system) may have an option: </p>
					<p>"Press 3 for internal services" To use this option the user must remember a digit 3 whilst figuring out if they need an internal service. Many people can not do this. It also requires them to press the correct digit. </p>
					<p>When a lot of irrelevant information is given before the correct option the user may give up, especially if they did not understand all the earlier options and information</p>
					<p>Allowing the 0 digit to get to a person, or having the first option "to weight for an person who can help you press 0" can consistently help</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More Details</h4>
					<p>Considerations for Speech Recognition</p>
					<ul>
						<li>For speech recognition based systems, an existing ETSI standard for voice commands for many European languages exists and should be used where possible [ETSI 202 076], keeping in mind that expecting people to learn more than a few commands places a burden on the user.</li>
						<li>Natural language understanding systems allow users to state their requests in their own words, and can be useful for users who have difficulty remembering menu options, or who have difficulty mapping the offered menu options to their goals. However, natural language interfaces can be difficult to use for users who have difficulty producing speech or language. Directed dialog (menu-based) fallback or transfer to an agent should be provided.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Follow requirements of legislation</p>
					<p>For example, the U.S. Telecommunications Act Section 255 Accessibility Guidelines [Section255] paragraph 1193.41 Input, control, and mechanical functions, clauses (g), (h) and (i) apply to cognitive disabilities and require that equipment should be operable without time-dependent controls, the ability to speak, and should be operable by persons with limited cognitive skills.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Getting started</h4>
					<p>This is essential for critical systems such as health, finance, communication, water and government services. </p>
					<p>Not important systems might only use the design requirement bellow (XX)</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Using user interaction dialogs in which the first option "to weight for a person who can help you press 0”.</li>
						<li>Using a user-interaction dialog, such as the standard "0" from any point, where there is easy access to a human operator who can help users achieve their goals.</li>
						<li>Advisory technique: Cue users to write something that may be useful at a later point, and give them time to do so.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
					<p><strong>Failure</strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Long menu systems that make it hard to find a person</li>

				<h3>Pattern: Provide help for complex information and tasks</h3>
				<p>Provide explanatory content for complex information and tasks, especially if it is important for successful completion of a task.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>The use of complex information, long documents and data in a particular format can present significant barriers to users with cognitive accessibility needs. Users should be able to understand the information and successfully complete described tasks without requiring further external assistance as much as possible. If content is sufficiently complex to cause barrier, it may be inaccessible and then additional supporting help should be provided.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More Details</h4>
					<p>The complexity of information may be inherent in the information itself, for example the language used, the quantity of information, or the subject matter. In this case, it is likely to need careful explanation, organisation and presentation for all users to be able to understand without any mistakes, confusion or need of assistance.</p>
					<p>In addition, the presentation mode of information, such as a graph, diagram or table, may obscure its meaning through complexity. Here, a supporting description and guided interpretation will highlight the the key features the user needs to understand.</p>
					<p>Help may be provided in various forms, for example</p>					
					<ul>
						<li>Text "asides" providing explanation and help for diagrams</li>						
						<li>A supporting chart or graph to illuminate text content</li>
						<li>A supplemental table – as long as it is not itself complex</li>
						<li>Popup on hover explanations of keywords - possibly linked to a glossary</li>
						<li>A flow chart of steps in a process</li>
					</ul>						
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The explanation of a medical procedure and success rate statistics is amplified through the use of an additional text aside, a diagram and a graph.</li>
						<li>The multi step process for applying for a visa is made made easier to use by adding flow chart of all the steps that is always visible. Each step in the flowchart has links to extra help and the current step is clearly highlighted</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
					<p><strong>Failure</strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A graph and data table of sales figures is shown without any explanation of the key features that relate to the content.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<h3>Pattern: Provide help with directions</h3>
				<p>Help is provided help with navigational systems and directions.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>Some people confuse their left with their right and so will may be unable will be unable to use navigation systems. Others may experience difficulty recognising relative and cardinal directions such as North, South, East, and West,</p>
					<p>Extra help with these ensures navigational systems and directions can easily be used without constant reminders being needed. Especially if it built in directly to the system or directions.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More Details</h4>
					<p>Providing alternative terms relative and cardinal directions if possible, for example “the drivers side”. This is helped with personalization.</p>
					<p>Consider using sing any standard mechanism for the platform or technologies that provide for personalization of relative and cardinal directions and terms.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Simple personalised disambiguation of left and right is always available</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
					<p><strong>Failure</strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Consistent reference to points of the compass including less well known ones (eg N by NE)</li>

				<h3>Pattern: Provide help for forms and non-standard controls</h3>
				<p>Provide help for any complex forms, particularly when there are multiple steps, unusual interactions or non-standard controls.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>Users often find forms and related tasks to be the most complex experience with web sites and can easily become confused, unsure, or even completely lost. Providing extra help can make the difference between being able to successfully complete a task and giving up. This is especially true if any part of the form is complex or provides non standard interactions.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More Details</h4>
					<p>The standard HTML forms and controls have been carefully specified for maximum usability and accessibility. They are usually understood by users, especially if they are familiar with web interactions. However, users are likely to experience difficulties if the standard form behaviour has been altered or completely new controls are provided. Assuming the new behaviours have been carefully designed and user tested, users may still require help in order to successfully use them.</p>
					<p>Examples of forms and controls that are likely to require additional help </p>
					<ul>
						<li>New behaviours like bank sort code fields where there is auto tabbing between the 3 boxes as digits are entered</li>
						<li><li>Password fields that require certain character types of characters to be entered</li>
						<li>Surveys with complex interactions, for example where buttons only appear depending on previous answers</li>
						<li>Date entry where there could be some ambiguity about the required format.</li>
						<li>Brand new controls like date pickers</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Help can be provided via various mechanisms, perhaps with an accessible help button next to a non standard control.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A help button next to date picker provides accessible pop-up help for using the control.</li>
						<li>A form has multiple steps. Users are informed on their progress through the stages.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
					<p><strong>Failure</strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A form has complex mechanism for enabling and disabling sections as you scroll or tab between them but no help is provided.</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Pattern: Provide human help</h3>
				<p>Ensure easy access to a human who can provide help and support. Support can be on accessibility, technical, process or domain based.</p>
				<p>Access to human help should never require the user to manage complex menu systems such as voice menus with different options. </p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>In cases where the user gets stuck or confused for any reason, contact with a human is usually the most effective and suitable solution. Otherwise the user may abandon the process and be left with negative attitude towards the service or supplier.</p>
					<p>One or more contact mechanisms should be easy to locate and use from any page or any step in a process. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<p>Examples include</p>
					<ul>
						<li>An option for live chat or video call help. Note: It must be full accessible and easy to close new windows that open as part of live help functionality.</li>
						<li>A phone number, ideally with a feature to automatically call via an interoperable Voice over IP specification.</li>
						<li>A simple site contact form.</li>
						<li>An email link using the ‘mailto’ protocol with prefilled “to” and “subject” fields. Note will not work on all platforms or depending of the users mail client </li>
						<li>Use available standards to get human help for example, using the 0 digit on voice menu systems</li>
					</ul>
					<p>It is important that voice communication is easy and this implies the person providing help can both be easily understood and is able to understand others, allowing for a range of vocal and verbal characteristics. Sensitivity to the requirements of people with learning cognitive disabilities is also important.</p>

				<h3>Pattern: Provide reminders</h3>
				<p>Make it easy for the user to set a reminder for date and time sensitive events. Use standard API’s when possible.</p>
				<p>Reminders must be set only at the user’s request and the user must be able to personalize the reminder method.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>People with cognitive and learning difficulties often have challenges managing events and time. In fact, being unable to correctly manage events and time without support is a diagnostic criteria for some groups of disabilities. This results in missing meetings, not submitting a request by a certain date or a form within a specified time period.
					<ul>
						<li>Using calendar APIs (or task manager)  that allow the user to automatically add events and deadlines to their own calendar can help in many cases, for example:</p>
						</li>When the user copies information into a calendar they often copy the day or time incorrectly.</li>
						</li>The user is challenged processing and retaining time based information.</li>
						</li>The user is challenged in sequencing time bound events.</li>
						<li>The user's skills decrease when tired to such an extent that they have to stop a task. They may wish to reschedule the task.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>For example, a user with a learning disability set a doctors appointment online. Often they copy the detailing incorrectly onto their calendar. However, the website gives them an option to add the appointment to the calendar and sets a reminder an hour before. The user now comes to the correct place at the correct time.</p>
					<p>The benefit to users with cognitive accessibility needs is that they can independently manage appointments, deadlines and schedules. The ability to set reminders can reduce the cognitive load associated when processing time bound tasks. Time dependent activities may be monitored and tracked by the user to ensure that they are completed in a timely manner.</p> 
					<p>Always give the option to set a reminder at the end of the task so that the user does not get interrupted. </p>
					<p>It is essential not to add unwanted reminders as this makes the users calendar too full. This can even prevent them from being able to use their calendar at all. The user is the best person to know how many reminders, and which type, will best meet their needs.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More Details</h4>
					<p>Where a standard mechanism exists for the platform or technologies, it must be used. See:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>[https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/notification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/notification)</li>
						<li>[https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/notifications/quick/](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/notifications/quick/)</li>
						<li>[https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/concepts/reminders](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/concepts/reminders)</li>
						<li>[https://docs.api.ai/docs/reminders-and-notifications](https://docs.api.ai/docs/reminders-and-notifications)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Date and time sensitive events are any event that has to be completed by a certain time. The time constraints on such an event may be defined by a calendar date and time or by the total elapsed time.</p>
					<p>Variables that could be considered on 'when to supply a reminder' include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Time - at a logical time</li>
						<li>Location - prompted when at an appropriate location</li>
						<li>Context - on computer vs. mobile, on specific site, etc</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This design  pattern addresses two broad classes of issues associated with this type of information:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>If the user perceives the activity to be too complex the user may decide to abandon the activity and therefore be excluded from the information and/or services derived from the completion of the activity.</li>
						<li>If the activity relies on a number of distinct events being carried out sequentially over an extended period of time or if a single event must be completed by a specified date and time then the likelihood of errors being made during the activity increases, particularly for users with cognitive accessibility needs. Activities are often missed because the date and time is confused.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> examples</p>
					<p class="ednote">Examples need fixing</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A health care site allows you to set a local medical appointment. Once the appointment is set the user is given the option to add it to their calendar (automatically) with a reminder three hours before. They are also given the option to add or edit the reminder.</li>

				<h3>Pattern: Make it easy to find help and feedback channels</h3>
				<p>Make it easy for the user to ask for help or  report issues. This includes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Easy to Use: Feedback information and forms are simple and clear. (User testing with different user groups is highly recommended.)</li>
					<li>Easy to Find: Available from any place where the user may get stuck</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The option to provide feedback should never require the user to manage complex menu systems such as Integrated Voice Menus (IVR) with many different options.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>Providing an easy way for users to give feedback will help people be able to share problems, ask for help, make suggestions and positive comments. If users cannot give feedback easily, problems will continue to exist without the site owner being aware of the problems. Ideas for improvements and positive feedback will also be missed.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More Details</h4>
					<p>Make sure the feedback option is:</p>
					<ul>
						<ul>simple to use</ul>
						<ul>available in all stages of the process</ul>
						<ul>has a process in place to respond helpfully to any feedback submitted</ul>
						<ul>does not make the user provide unnecessary information</ul>
						<ul>does not rely on complex menu systems</ul>
					</ul>
					<p>Providing multiple methods for gathering feedback is recommended.  For example, on a website, consider providing all 4 options for feedback including live chat, a phone number, a web form and a feedback email address. </p>
					<p>Note that chat bots may not be appropriate for this particular type of feedback other than to start the feedback process.  These can be extremely frustrating if you cannot easily get to the area you are trying to reach.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p class="ednote">Examples not in correct format</p>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
					</ul>
					<p>A banking website had a major accessibility problem. This problem blocked some customers from paying their bills online. One of these customers found a feedback form on the page where they got stuck. The customer was able to report the problem. A help desk employee reached out to the customer and helped them complete their bill payment successfully. That help desk employee also reported the accessibility problem to the software team. The software team corrected the problem in the next software release.  The new design was easier for all users and resulted in more customers successfully paying their bills on time.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Web Chat or Web Call - An option to provide feedback using live chat or a video call. Note: The live chat or video call feature must be fully accessible. Web chat should not be a distraction and easy to close. Check usability with user testing. </li>
						<li>Phone - A feedback phone number, ideally with a feature to automatically call via Voice over IP.  Make sure there are no complex voice menus. </li>
						<li>Web Form - A simple site contact form with no more than 3  required fields</li>
						<li>Email - An email link using the ‘mailto’ protocol with prefilled “to” and “subject” fields. Note will not work on all platforms or all mail clients. </li>
						<li>Interactive Voice Response (IVR) - Provide an automatic option at the end of a IVR to give feedback by pressing a specific digit on the phone.</li>

				<h3>Pattern: Enable APIs and extensions</h3>
				<p>Allow supporting APIs and extensions  to work with your content.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>People with cognitive disabilities are often using add-ons or extensions as assistive technology. This includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Reading of the long form of acronyms
						<li>Support for text-to-speech with synchronized highlighting of the phrase being read</li>
						<li>Content simplification</li>
						<li>Creating mind maps out of the heading structure</li>
						<li>Support for retaining content that has already been entered</li>
						<li>Password management</li>
						<li>Spell checking</li>
						<li>Changing the symbols or the interface</li>
					</ul>
				<p>If these functions are not supported, the author should provide all support all the functions of the add-ons in use as assistive technology.</p>
				<p>For example , a user with traumatic brain injury has executive function and memory impairments impacting their ability to remember details such as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The Internet of Things (IoT) interface<
					</li>Their user name and password/<li>
					</li>What an acronym stands for</li>
					<li>A phone number</section>li>
					</li>The meaning of uncommon words</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Supporting the use of an add on that simplifies content and adds help (such as the long form of acronyms, and a popup dictionary) enables them to understand most content.</p>
				<p>Supporting password management tools enables him to successfully login and avoid being locked out of secure sites.</p>
				<p>Storing non-sensitive information and auto complete helps them fill out a form. This suggests common information, like a person's phone number or address. It also helps them avoid making mistakes. It eliminates the need for accurately recalling this information from memory or having to copy and paste it, which is a task that often prevent them from successfully using a form.</p>
				<p>When overwhelmed by textual content, they have an extension that inserts symbols that they are familiar with that helps them find the content they need.</p>
				<p>However, sometimes a web site stops their extensions and API’s from working. The result is that the use can not use this web site.</p>
				<h5>>The Internet of Things (IoT) and the Web of things.</h5>
				<p>Another example is a person that has a language related disability (e.g. Dyslexia) which may cause them to read at a slower rate. They often miss objects and information that they did not know they needed to read. While high-literacy readers scan text, low-literacy users may read the text “word-for-word.” This means they only know what is written when they have intentionally read out. This is similar to having a narrow field of view and they can be unaware of other items not directly in the flow of text that they are reading.They may also miss things on the page that help them understand what to do. For example, there may be a side bar or call out box which helps make decisions about which link to go to that matches their particular needs. These readers may select the earlier option they encounter, because they may not have noticed (or prioritized) reading that side bar content. They also might miss information that is essential for successfully completing an interaction.</p>
				<p>Too many options may add to the complexity of interacting with IoT devices. Additional options should be easy to ignore and not require a lot of reading to understand that they are additional, as well as how to skip them.</p>
				<p>Sometimes IoT interfaces may confuse the user, such as a default "reading" on a meter being set to “2” and not “1.” The user would then need to reset it to “1.”</p>
				<p>It is important in any proposed solution to make operational tasks, such as interacting with the IoT, as transparent as possible so that users can focus their attention on the functional aspects, such as relating to content..</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More Details</h4>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Getting started</h4>
					<p>This includes: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Support of standards for the Internet of Things that allow for simplified and personalized interfaces such as the ISO/IEC 24752 “Universal Remote Console Framework” standard, URC</li>
						<li>Standardized techniques to support interoperable symbol sets that are used when available.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Exceptions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>When there is a security or safety requirement, these API's may be disabled for the relevant field</li>
						<li>If it breaks the main function of the site, such as evaluation and testing applications</li>

						<li>Testing verified through the use of some of the  APIs appropriate for the content. For example:</li>
						<li>Testing with spell checker and password storage apps or extensions</li>
						<li>Test with an extension that add to the left click</li>
						<li>Test with a toolbar that enables simplification or personalization and is designed for people with cognitive disabilities </li>

				<h3>Pattern: Support simplification</h3>
				<p>Support simplification of your content. Often this includes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Allowing the user to remove or hide features that most users do not use or that are not essential. </li>
					<li>Allowing the user to get less test or more simple text</li>
				</ul>		
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>A user who has difficulty reading or using  Web content can be easily overwhelmed with too much information on a web page. They need to simplify the page to just the critical information that they need and not spend all their energy reading and understanding other content and features.  This is also true for users who are easily distracted.</p>
					<p>For example, an email program has lots of features and formatting options when drafting an email. This makes it t to complex for a lot of people. With personalization the user can have a simple options with only send and cancel options. There is a “to” and subject line but no cc or bcc options. In this setting there is a clear heading (write an email) and they have icons that the user understands.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More Details</h4>
					<p>Note that: </p>
					<ul><li>
						<li>Typically a simple application has 3 to 6 functions.</li>
						<li>Make sure it is easy to get back to the full featured version</li>
						<li>You can meet this design pattern by:</li>
						<li>Use aui-simplification on regions and controls</li>
						<li>Use other attributes in personalization semantics</li>
						<li>Add a simplification toolbar</li>
						<li>Provide an alternative version</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Getting started</h4>
					<p>Add aui-simplification=”critical” on content that is in any critical user testing paths</p>
				</section>

					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> examples</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Simplified “reading” view is available and easy to close.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
					<p><strong>Failure</strong> examples</p>

				<h3>Pattern: Support personalization of symbols and controls</h3>
					<p>Add semantics on control links and symbols that  allows extra support that is appropriate for each user. For example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Html 5 autocomplete on common fields</li>
						<li>Adding a toolbar that adds personalized images</li>
						<li>Use attributes in personalization semantics</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="ednote">Personalization technology is still young. At the of publication HTML autocorrect on fields was the best supported.</p>
					<section>
						<h4>How it helps</h4>
						<p>Personalization changes the interface to meet the needs of the user.</p>
						<p>Having familiar terms and symbols is key to many users being able to use the web. However, what is familiar for one user may be unfamiliar to another requiring them to learn new symbols. Adding semantics allow symbols and support to be added by an extension or browser that is familiar to the individual user.</p>
						<p>A stronger example is people using Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC) systems. AAC systems designed for people who are non-verbal often use symbols with or without text.</p>
						<p>These users usually only learn one symbol set. They cannot easily communicate with other symbol users in a written format or may struggle to understand different symbols used in different applications. Some symbols are subject to copyright and cannot be shared across applications.</p>
						<p>If users' symbols are mapped to the same concepts, then user agents can load the symbols that are understandable by the user and they user can access the web and other applications.</p>
						<p>Other support include autocomplete and extension that help the user fill out forms and understand the content. Many users with memory or executive functions  impairments could not fill in forms without asking someone to help copy over information or check their work. Autocomplete, many more users to manage  forms by themselves. </p>						</section>
