			<h1>Introduction</h1>

			<p>Making websites and applications that are friendly for people with cognitive impairments affects every part of design and development.</p>
			<p>Traditionally accessibility has been most focused on the interface, and making that usable for people with sensory and physical impairments in vision, hearing and/or mobility. Some accessibility features will help people with cognitive impairments, but often the issues are about context, language, usability, and other more general factors that impact everyone to some degree.</p>
			<p>This document aims to provide guidance on how to make websites and applications that are friendly for people with cognitive impairments by providing guidance for your designs, and design process.</p>
			<p>This guide is divided into design themes. There are also user stories, testing methodologies, and design checkpoints for each theme. Just understanding the themes and user stories may help make your content more accessible to some users with cognitive and learning disabilities. Please see the section on user testing for guidance on how to perform COGA user testing.</p>
			<p class="ednote">EDITOR’S note: This is an early draft. We expect many editorial changes to make the content more clear and easy to understand. We will also change the format along the lines of https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/</p>

				<h3>Pattern: Make the purpose of your page clear</h3>
				<p>Use a  clear title or heading that summarizes the purpose of a page, or other clear signposts that have been tested by users with cognitive disabilities.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps </h4>
					<p>This helps many people, including those with poor memory, attention, or anyone who is easily distracted. This includes people with age-appropriate forgetfulness, or Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.</p>
					<p>For example, someone with mild dementia is using online shopping. They get distracted and then when they look at the screen again they have forgotten what they were doing. Put a clear heading at the top of each page that shows clearly <strong>what the page is about and what they are doing</strong>.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<p>Heading need to clarify the purpose of this specific page</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> example:  Headings tell me exactly where I am</p>
					
					<p><strong>Failure </strong>example: Heading that doesn't clarify the step in a form</p>
					<p><strong>Todo: add this example </strong></p>
					<p><strong>Failure </strong>example: Service not available…. what service? </p>
					<p>I have to remember what I was doing to know what service this is about.</p>

				<h3>Pattern: Make Each Step Clear</h3>
				<p>In a multistep process, clearly indicate the steps completed, the current step and the steps pending. Ensure the user can quickly determine the current location and progress within a sequence.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>Clearly indicating the current location and progress helps a user who loses focus or gets distracted reorient to their current activity without reading a great deal of content or restarting.  Providing information about the steps that need to be completed ensures that a user who may find a process difficult to complete can determine if they can successfully finish. </p>
					<p>Examples include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>someone with dementia loses focus and then can not remember what they were doing</li>
						<li>someone with an attention disability gets distracted and then needs to pick up were they left off</li>
						<li>someone with a learning disability is not sure if this application has too many steps and if they will manage. By seeing they are half-way through they can gauge if they can cope with the entire process.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> example: Using breadcrumbs to indicate the current step in the process as well as past and future steps. </p>

				<h3>Pattern: Use Graphical indicators to group and highlight information</h3>
				<p>Use graphical indicators to help people identify when items that are associated with each other or have a different purpose to surrounding information.</p>
				<p>Examples of common graphical indicators are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Group summaries of content with images, such as using a card design</li>
					<li>Flag importing important information, such as using call out boxes</li>
					<li>Indicate different types as information, such as placing quotes in speech bubbles.</li>
				</ul>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>Visual of grouping of information is based on the psychological principle of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001002859290014S">Common Regions</a>. It has been found that the grouping information using a border or colour shading makes it easier for people to identify groups, even if the content of the group is not similar.</p>
					<img alt="Example of the Common Regions grouping principle. picuture1" src="img/common-region-1.png">
					<img alt="Example of the Common Regions grouping principle. picuture2" src="img/common-region-2.png">
					<p>Figures: Example of the Common Regions grouping principle.</p>
					<p>These graphical indicators allow people to identify structure and information types without reading text or have problems distinguishing groups of information. Using the graphical indicators consistently to indicate similar types of items aids with navigating content and reduces the cognitive load.</p>
					<p>People who have difficulty with recognising or comprehending written language, having difficulties with concentration or memory can find it easier to process graphical cues.</p>
					<p>People on the autism spectrum are more likely to identify graphical indicators and the use of colour for grouping content than other approaches.</p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<p>Graphical indicators should also be presented programmatically to enable assistive technologies to interpret the graphical indicators. It is also important the graphical indicators do not clutter the interface and are used consistently as that can add an additional cognitive load for users to process.</p>

				<h3>Pattern: Chunk Media</h3>
				<p>Long pieces of media are divided into logical segments with a description of each segment.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>Providing shorter logical segments allows a person to find and review a specific topic.  If that person loses concentration or steps away, clear segmentation allows them to easily find their place in the material and start again. This is especially important for educational style content where review is often necessary.</p>
					<p>Chunking media also allows for each segment to be given a unique URL and so easily referenced and shared.</p>
					<p>For example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Some videos can be naturally organized into chapters or segments</li>
						<li>A podcast can be split into segments rather than a single one hour recording</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Six minutes or less</strong>: Media should typically be divided into segments that are 6 minutes or less in duration.</li>
						<li><strong>Navigable</strong>: Navigation to each media segment, and a unique, descriptive label must be provided.</li>
						<li><strong>Logical order</strong>: Navigation to media segments are presented in a logical order.</li>
						<li><strong>Exception</strong>: Media that has no logical breaking points, do not need to be subdivided.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Success </strong>example: A 30 minute video is divided into 5 sections, each with a descriptive link to play from that point onwards.</li>
						<li><strong>Failure </strong>example: A 30 minute video contains no subdivisions or descriptions of sections, forcing the user to play it from the beginning or guess starting locations within the video.</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Pattern: Make the purpose of each section clear</h3>
				<p>Make the purpose of each section clear. Often this involves providing clear headings that briefly defines the purpose of each section. Extraneous information that is not directly relevant to the main purpose of a page should be distinctly separated and programmatically determinable.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>Each page or section of content should be organised and marked so that its purpose is obvious. This might be through the use of headings or labels or even a pyramid style of writing or even non textual markers (with suitable alternatives). A clear organisation of content into pages and sections with obvious purpose allows users to more easily locate relevant sections and to be confident that those they read in detail will match their purposes. There will also be no need to read all the content in case something important is missed. For example, Ads that appear in-line in a section of content are rarely related to the purpose of a section and can be placed in a separate clearly delimited section.</p>
					<p>Here are some examples of how this will help people:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A person with memory issues may need a clear heading structure to stay focused.</li>
						<li>Someone with an attention disability gets distracted and then needs to pick up where they left off and headings help</li>
						<li>A slow reader may depend on a heading structure to find important information they need without forcing them to read the whole document.</li>
						<li>Someone with dementia loses focus and then can not remember what they were doing</li>
						<li>Someone with a learning disability is not sure if this application has too many steps and if they will manage. By seeing they are halfway though they can gauge if they can cope with the entire process.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>For example, An elementary school publishes a weekly newsletter with interesting stories about activities and important announcements. Important announcements include early school dismissal. If the newsletter has a good heading structure, it will be easier for a parent who is a slow reader to find the important announcements about early school dismissal. Without a good heading structure, the important early dismissal information can be easily missed. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>The heading structure should create an outline of the document that could serve as an abstract of the whole document.</li>
						<li>Heading structure makes the content easier to scan and find more detailed information that a person needs at a moment.</li>

							<li>“Clearly label content categories; assist recognition and retrieval rather than recall.“</li>
							<li>“If pages are dense with content, is content grouped or otherwise clustered to show what is related?” </li>

						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Success </strong>example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>(find from bbc gel)</li>
						<li>Show an excellent example with headings in html</li>
						<li>Section Abstract - one sentence that describes the purpose of this section.</li>
						<li>Collapsable sections</li>

				<h3>Pattern: Make it clear what are controls and how they should be used</h3>
				<p>Use a clear design for controls by:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Using a common style on controls (for example:  links being underlined)</li>
					<li>Using common  design pattern on links and controls  (for example: clicking on a link takes you to the page)</li>
					<li>Make all the borders of controls clear other than textual links  (for example: a help icon has a border)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>When this is not possible, provide instructions that explain their use. Instructions should be on the same page or one click away and written in plain language. </p>
				<section>
					<h4>How It Helps</h4>
					<p>Using common style and design pattern on controls makes it easier to recognise and understand how to use it. Controls are parts of web pages that do something, e.g. a link, button, checkbox. The goal of these controls is to have someone use them. </p>
					<p>Some users have trouble when controls have a different look, color or shape than they have used before. For example, when links do not have underlines and blue or purple text (even if this appears with focus) some users will not know there is a link.</p>
					<p>If you have difficulty with memory, it can be harder to use unique controls. It may be slower to find them on the page. And even if they work just a little differently than similar ones, some may need to relearn how to use them each time they need to use them.</p>
					<p>Using typical controls on the page will help people know how to use them. When using more unique controls, include easy to follow instructions and make them easy to find. Regardless of how a user uses the page (vision, auditory, voice input) it should be easy to identify, understand and use the controls.</p>
					<p>If you are designing a new control, make them easy to identify (I know they are there), understand (I know what they do), and use (I know how to use them). Test with people with different cognitive and learning disabilities.  Use a simple style or have easy to follow instructions that explain their use.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Good Examples</strong>:</p>
					<p>Links with an underline and/or blue text color (or purple for already visited links), or both clearly identify links. Once a color is selected to be the primary link text color, other text on the page does not use this.</p>
					<p>In the example below, the links have an underline and are blue, or they are blue. There is no text that is blue that is not a link.</p>
					<!-- <div>
						<img alt="Links with an underline and/or blue text color" src="img/link-with-underline.png" height="486" width="700">
					</div> -->
					<p><strong>Poor Examples</strong></p>
					<p>Links without an underline or usual blue text color (or purple for already visited links), even those that become clear when they receive focus are more difficult to use. Some users may not know they are there. </p>
					<p>In the example below, the links do not have an underline, and they are not blue. Also, this page lacks a consistent link text color so easy to follow instructions would not be helpful.</p>
					<p>The black rectangles are around text that is a link, some of which has green text, others with black. The red circles are around green text which is not a link. </p>
					<!-- <div>
						<img alt="Links without an underline or usual blue text color " src="img/link-without-underline.png" height="486" width="700">
					</div> -->
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Technical Resources and History</h4>
					<p>Questions raised in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues/36">github </a>discussion:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Defining controls</li>
						<li>
							2.4.4 Link purpose. "The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or..."
							<ul>
								<li>
									Difference: how do I know it is a link?
									<ul>
										<li>E.g. can I ask all links to be underlined and blue if this is not their automatic state?</li>
										<li>
											I know something is a link because:
											<ul>
												<li>Underlined and blue (or purple if a visited link) – if I have vision</li>
												<li>Announces as link – if using text to speech tool</li>
												<li>Cursor change</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>3.2.4 Consistent Identification. Components that have the same functionality within a set of content are identified consistently.
							<ul>
								<li>If unusual, even if consistent, this does not make it easy to identify</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>3.2.2 Labels or instructions are provided when content requires user input.
							<ul>
								<li>If style selected requires instructions, slows down person using them.</li>

				<h3>Pattern: Each region and its controls can be clearly recognized</h3>
				<p>Make the relationship between different parts of the page clear by:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Use clear dividers between different sections in a page that may have separate controls or a scroll bar </li>
					<li>Use clear dividers around areas in a page with different functions, such as call out boxes, navigation bars, and advertisements.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Avoiding multiple scrolling areas/regions in a page will also help.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Examples of clear dividers include high contrast borders or white space. A change in background color can be a clear divider if the contrast is strong enough.</li>
						<li>Sometimes the structure and relationships can be made clear through personalization or user agents and good use of semantics in the code  (see WCAG 2.0  SC 1.3.1).</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>Controls that affect only one section of a page can be confusing. Having a border around the controls and the relevant page section is helpful.  If the controls cannot be next to the area they affect, check with user testing that the users find all the page relationships clear and immediately know how to use the controls. </p>
					<p>For example, consider someone with dementia trying to work out which scrollbar to use if there are more than one embedded in scrollable regions. When users try the wrong scrollbar, they do not get the effect they desire. Many users will look again at the content, try and work out what they are supposed to do, and discover the correct scrollbar. However, many people with cognitive disabilities will not be able to work out what they did incorrectly. Others will feel cognitive overload, and will give up before they try. They may assume the application is broken, or that it is just too complicated for them. For all of these users, the application will not be usable.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Failures Examples</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>When scrollbars are embedded in scrollable regions, and it is unclear which scrollbar to use.</li>
						<li>The search box relates to one area of a page, and not for another area. It is unclear which area the search is for.</li>
						<li>Controls act on one region and t is not clear which areas are acted on.</li>

				<h3>Pattern: Clear Structure and Relationships</h3>
				<p>Structure, content and controls must be easy to identify and understand.</p>
				<p>The user should not experience difficulty identifying which control to use with specific parts of the content, or how to use the controls. The user should be provided visual cues and text that communicate the structure and layout of the page.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How It Helps</h4>
					<p>This helps many people, including those with cognitive disabilities that impact problem solving skills, those that get overwhelmed when presented with a lot of text, and those with difficulties with more complicated tasks. This can include some individuals with early stages of dementia, people who have had a concussion or a stroke, people with intellectual disabilities, and others. Those impacted may not complete tasks, miss key information, and not return to pages that are complicated to use and understand.</p>
					<p>By creating clear layouts, with easy to use controls, a greater number of individuals can focus on the task instead of spending time figuring out how to use the controls and information. They easily find key information, and are more likely to return to the page.</p>
					<p>One example: do not have two scroll bars close together. Some users may find it difficult to determine which one to use with a particular section of content. Instead, use clear visual layout and placement of the scroll bars, break the content into two separate pages, or consider removing unnecessary information from the page.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More Details</h4>
					<p>Some people with disabilities need a clear layout to help them know how to use the information. When structure and relationships are unclear, end users may need to experiment with different layouts and structures until they work out how to use them. However, people with cognitive disabilities may not be able to do so, and may not be able to use the content or application.</p>
					<p><strong>Example 1: </strong>A website has 2 scroll bars, each operates a different section. When users try the wrong scroll bar, they do not get the effect they desire. Many users will look again at the content; try and work out what they are supposed to do; and discover the correct scroll bar. However, many people with cognitive disabilities will not be able to work out what they did incorrectly. Others will feel cognitive overload, and will give up before they try. They may assume the application is broken, or that it is just too complicated for them. For all of these users, the application will not be usable.</p>
					<p><strong>Example 2: </strong>Chunks of content run into each other with a "flat design". Whereas some users can work out which chunks belong together, many users with cognitive disabilities will find it challenging or impossible. Thus, all the benefits of chunking content are lost.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> examples include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Using Summary Content</strong> - Placing an outline of content at the top of the page, and/or key information and elements “above the fold” will provide greater access. For example, in an email application, the send button should be near the top so it is easy to find and use.</li>
						<li><strong>Separating Content</strong> - White space, call outs, and other methods should be used in addition to headings to help define sections of content. This organizes the information on the page so it is easier to determine layout and find specific information.</li>
						<li><strong>Separating Interactive Elements </strong>- Place interactive elements like scroll bars and buttons close to the content they can impact. Also, keep interactive elements further from content to which they do not apply. This makes it easier to identify which elements will impact each section of content.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Failure</strong> examples include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Users may not be easily able to find features that do not display in their initial view of the page (items “under the fold”). For example, in an email application, the send button being located under the email’s body text.</li>
						<li>Dense text, with little white space, no call outs, and a lack of visually differentiated headings to define sections.</li>
						<li>Pages with scroll bars close together that impact different content areas. </li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Pattern: Sub-menu items that are clearly associated with the main menu items under which they fall</h3>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>Confusion can occur when visual hierarchy of information is not immediately apparent to the user.  Distinction between levels in content hierarchy may be difficult to understand or perceive due to minimal type size or type weight differences or color differences that are not easily perceived or understood.  Furthermore hierarchy solely dependent on small unique design elements [s.a. rotating chevrons unique similar sized icons] may create confusion.  </p>
					<p>For example a drop down accordion menu of additional submenu items may not be viewable without understanding it needs to be clicked (or ‘rolled over’)  as indicated by  a small unique design element.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<p>Small design elements that indicate submenu items will be presented that aren’t always readily apparent or meaningful to the user and not universally adopted. </p>
					<p>Examples include a chevron (triangle). In different designs It can be either left facing right facing, up facing or down facing depending on state and the unique design standard affecting interpretation of state. </p>
					<p>Confusion can occur when a right facing chevron can indicate that more information will be presented on the current page when clicked or it may mean that information is currently being presented, or it may indicate that it takes the user to a new page.  Consistent and general best practices should be used to make it understandable to the user. </p>
					<p>Furthermore a series of these nested elements on a long page can create visual hierarchy confusion if dependent solely on interpretation of design elements.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Getting started</h4>

				<h3>Pattern: Use a design that the user is likely to recognise and understand</h3>
				<p>Use common design elements, affordances, and patterns that are familiar to most users.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>Many users, such as those with mild cognitive impairment or dementia, cannot easily learn and remember new design metaphors. Without these skills, it can be much harder or impossible to locate desired items to interact with, and to know what interactions may do. Users can feel lost or overwhelmed.</p>
					<p>Because common design elements are repeated often over a long period of use across many sites, users are more likely to recognize the interactions needed.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<p>Common design elements, affordances and patterns include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Links that look like links and buttons look and act like buttons
							<li>For example, underline links with a standard style throughout a page</li>
							<li>Links general navigate to a new page</li>
							<li>Buttons general perform an action</li>
						</li>
						<li>
							Uses common design patterns, such as are documented in the ARIA authoring best practices or are used in the most popular sites
							<li>Very common navigation design patterns and common icons.</li>
							<li>A platform specific user interface design for navigation mechanisms and icons</li>
							<li>An adaptive user interface design that can be personalized (see above).</li>
						</li>
						<li>
							Create a standard Visual Hierarchy - Place elements where the user is expecting them, such as
							<li>Putting the search in the top right hand corner in a website</li>
							<li>The link to the home page is in the top left hand corner</li>
							<li>Link to ‘contact us’ is in the top navigation</li>
							<li>Link to the site map is in the footer area</li>
							<li>Submit button is at the bottom right for a form</li>
						</li>
						<li>
							User interface (design) from a prior version: Allow users to revert back to a prior version of the application that they are familiar with.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Getting started</h4>
					<p>When deciding pages, select standard components that look and behave the way users expect. Use standard conventions for layout such as the home link in the upper left corner, navigation at the top, search in the upper right, etc. and create an obvious visual hierarchy in the page. </p>

				<h3>Pattern: Use a consistent visual design</h3>
				<p>Use a consistent visual design with a stable look and feel.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>Those with difficulty understanding how to interact with information need to use cues like color, layout and other visual information to help them know where to look, what they should do and how they should complete that task. </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Ensures consistent user experience by providing familiarity and building confidence</li>
						<li>Makes it possible to easily use and interact with content</li>
						<li>Aids the completion of tasks</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<p>This includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Design themes, including heading styles, font choices, symbols, colors, visual appearance of controls, buttons and links should be consistent.</li>
						<li>Headings with the same structural level have the same font and visual style.</li>
						<li>Icons, controls and menu items that have same function and role have the same look and style</li>
						<li>State and focus for elements with similar function and roles have the same style used consistently across a site.</li>
						<li>Layout should be consistent, including position of interactive elements and navigational controls.</li>
						<li>Structure of content and style of presenting information should be consistent throughout, such as organization of block text, images and bullet points.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Getting started</h4>
					<p>Plan the design for your information before adding content. Think about the colours, font choices and areas where text and images will appear. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples </h4>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> examples:</p>
					<p>A web page has two submit buttons, both should visually look and function the same way.</p>
					<p>All selected radio buttons on the site look the same.</p>
					<p>When all links on a page have keyboard focus the focus indicator looks the same.</p>
					<p><strong>Failure</strong> examples:</p>
					<p>3 pages have a submit button, but each one is located in a different place on the page.</p>
					<p>There are 6 heading level 2s on a page. 4 are styled using Times New Roman, and 2 use Helvetica.</p>

				<h3>Pattern: Use symbols that help the user</h3>
				<p>Add familiar images and pictographics with a single meaning to aid understanding.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>People who have language comprehension difficulties who may be able to mechanically read but not understand the content or those who have learning and/or reading difficulties may rely on symbols to understand content and navigate to content they need.</p>
					<p>For example, a person with aphasia, has the intellectual ability to understand concepts, but struggles with language. They may be dependent on the use of symbols to browse pages for information.</p>
					<p>It can also help the elderly population who can find cluttered pages with dense text hard to read on a screen. Clear symbols and images that act as signposts to the text content can be very helpful.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Use personalization semantics  (add link)</li>
						<li>Use clear and unambiguous symbols that can easily be seen and made larger</li>
						<li>Be aware of cultural differences</li>
						<li>In left-to-right languages, place the image to the left of the text</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Getting started</h4>
					<p>Provide symbols besides key texts, headings, contact us  and  help</p>
					<p>Find the common symbol used</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples </h4>
					<p><strong>Success</strong> example:</p>
					<p>A set of instructions where the bullet points are symbols relating to the content within the text.</p>
					<p><strong>Failure</strong> example:</p>
					<p>A page with important instructions and no symbols or images to guide the reader or a very cluttered page of symbols that confuses. </p>

            	<p>Key content such as:</p>
            	<ul>
            		<li>Interactions for critical features (e.g login forms)</li>
            		<li>Important information (e.g health warnings)</li>
            	</ul>
            	<p>Must visually stand out and be visible to users without needing to scroll the page.</p>
            	<section>
            		<h4>How it helps</h4>
            		<p>People with low executive function, impaired memory, and other cognitive and learning disabilities may not be able to find features that require the use of the scroll bar.</p>
            		<p>Users who are unfamiliar with the page (or common design patterns) rely on prominent visual styling aids to locate important information.</p>
            	</section>
            	<section>
            		<h4>More Details</h4>
            		<p>The amount of page visible before scrolling is dependent on a wide range of factors such as physical device size, resolution, pixel density and device setup.</p>
            		<p>The size of the visible region will be site specific. Where possible, use site statistics to understand the technology users are using and keep this in mind when designing the page.</p>

            	<section>
            		<h4>Getting Started</h4>
            		<p>Identify key content and its placement early in the design process.</p>
            		<p>Space at the top of the document is most likely to be visible to users without scrolling. Placing key content at the top of the page will give the best experience to the widest range of users.</p>
            		<p>Consider the most constrained user experience first (eg, a 240px wide mobile phone) and then design upwards from there in order to encounter the widest range of scenarios.</p>
            		<p>Conducting user testing can identify common user cases and barriers. Adopting responsive development practices can improve the flexibility of the page to a range of different devices and stations.</p>

            	<h3>Pattern: Add search</h3>
            	<p>Search: Provide a search capability.</p>
            	<section>
            		<h4>How it helps</h4>
            		<p>Having a search capability allows users to find the content they need even if they cannot manage to find content via the site menus or other browsing mechanisms. A user can learn how to use search and reuse that skill on many sites.</p>
            		<p>User studies have shown the aging population tend to rely on search to locate information rather than navigating menus or surfing.</p>
            		<p>Menu systems, and most site navigation require the user to understand the categories of the pages that the content provider has created for general use. Users with impaired executive function may be unable to identify the correct categories.</p>
            		<p>In some cases, users know the correct category via memory, rather than logic. For example, most users remember that the print function is often found under the file menu. Users with impaired memory may not be able to find these menu items based on recall.</p>
            		<p>Navigating a site and going to many pages to look for content, is also difficult for people with impaired short-term memory or for people who are easily distracted, as they may lose focus and forget what they are looking for.</p>
            		<p>Search is most useful when it corrects misspellings, finds appropriate or related content or provides suggested auto-corrected versions of the search terms that the user can choose from.</p>

				<h3>Pattern: Always let the user go back </h3>
				<p>Let the user return to a previous point without undoing their work.</p>
				<p>The standard back button is the best way to do this as it is familiar to the user and this might be the way they will try first. The user should never lose their work if they try pressing back. </p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>This helps prevent users from making mistakes and makes it easy to correct mistakes when they happen.</p>
					<p>Examples of mistakes include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>touching a control by accident,</li>
						<li>opening a new link by accident,</li>
						<li>closing a window that you intended to keep open.</li>
					</ul>
					<p> If a person easily makes mistakes or makes them often, it is important that they can go back and make changes without having their work or previous choices  deleted.</p>
					<p>In forms, each time the user has to re-enter data there is a new chance for mistakes to occur. Entering and re-entering data can be stressful and tiring from some people with learning and cognitive disabilities. This increases the likelihood of mistakes and may make it impossible to submit correct data and complete the intended task.</p>
					<p>For those with anxiety, memory challenges, and difficulty following directions, the ability to go back and review information they have entered is very important. For example, for some people the task of following directions and reviewing their answers works best as two separate tasks. Being able to enter information with their focus being on following the directions, and later going back to review their answers, helps them be more effective.</p>
					<p>When the user has an opportunity to go back and review the data they entered, even ifsubmitted by mistake, it is easier to correct the information.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
						<h4>More details</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>A user can go back steps in a user journey via a clearly labelled action.</li>
							<li>Clickable breadcrumbs are provided with clickable previous steps and no loss of data.</li>
							<li>Providing back and undo features without unwanted data loss.</li>
							<li>Using semantics and personalization to log the steps and return to a step in the process.</li>
							<li>A user can go back to a closed window or option.</li>
						</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
						<h4>Examples</h4>
						<p><strong>Success </strong>example:</p>
						<p>Completing an online form when applying for a job. The user is able to go back through all the screens to be sure they did not misunderstand a section, skip an answer, and can edit any data they mistyped.</p>
						<p><strong>Failure </strong>example:</p>
						<p>Completing an online form when applying for a job. The user goes back a screen because they realize they may have forgotten to answer a question. When they use the back button all data previously entered has been cleared/deleted.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
						<h4>Technical details</h4>
						<p>The following are proposals for WCAG. They experiment with more testable language:<a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues/38">wacg issue 38</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues/53">>wacg issue 53</a></p>
						<p>This is not to be used if going back may cause a security issue.</p>
						<p>This is different from 3.3.6 because 3.3.6 is AAA level but this is a need for a wide variety of users (more of an A or AA level requirement). Also, 3.3.6 refers to reviewing and confirming capabilities, but it does not address the concept of an entire form - it can be interpreted to mean a single form control. The challenge for those with learning and cognitive disabilities may increase when multiple form controls or entries are required together. For example, a job application, government services application, etc. Different types of information (data like number identifiers) mixed with short or long paragraph information, mixed with “if this” then “enter this” directions. The more complex and long the data to be entered, the more an individual may need to be able to go back and review multiple entries, not just one at a time.</p>

				<h3>Pattern: Use clear words </h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Use common and clear words. Look at the most common 1500 words or phrases. These are the terms that people with severe language impairments are most likely to know.</li>
					<li>Remove unnecessary words</li>
					<li>Do not invent new words or give words new meanings in your application.  Do not expect people to learn new meanings for words just to use your content. If you must make a new terms make sure the user has access to an explanation within one click or event. </li>
				</ul>
				<section>
					<h4>Getting started</h4>
					<p>Start by putting clear words on headings labels, navigational elements, instructions, and error messages. This will increase the usability a lot without taking so long. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>This benefits many people including those with language impairments, learning disabilities or a poor memory. </p>
					<p>For example, someone with mild dementia is trying to turn on an ICT heating and air conditioning unit. The menu item for selecting heat or air conditioning is labeled "mode". The user cannot use the whole unit because of this one term.  This has caused emergencies such as hypothermia.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<p>When different people find different abbreviations or terms easier to understand:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Add an simple language term in brackets next to it </li>
						<li>As a pop up definition</li>
						<li>In supported mark up (see easylang) </li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Success </strong>example: Plain text  with clear words and definition of term.</p>
					<p>Your landlord must follow the law. </p>
					<ul>

						<li>Your landlord must return your<strong> security deposit (promise money)</strong> to you by a clear date. This is usually 30 days after you leave the apartment.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Failure </strong>example: Not plain text</p>
					<p>A Landlord's Right to Deduct. When a tenant moves into a rental property, he or she will pay the landlord a security deposit. Depending on the jurisdiction, this deposit will be returned to the tenant within a specific time period at the cessation of the lease term, as long as the tenant follows all the terms and tenants of the lease agreement or contract.

				<h3>Pattern: Use a simple tense and written language</h3>
				<p>Use the tense and the voice is easiest to understand. In English this is usually the present tense and active voice. Speak directly to the user, and use the simplest form of verbs.</p>
				<p>Active voice makes it clear who is supposed to do what. For example “It must be done.” (passive voice) does not say who has to do what.  “You must do it.” is active voice and is more clear.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>This benefits many people including those with language impairments, learning disabilities or a poor memory.   For example, more people will understand “press the on button” (present tense and active voice) then “the on button should be pressed”. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Other voices or tenses can be used when it has been shown to be easier to understand or friendlier. </li>
						<li>In languages where present tense and active voice do not exist, or are not clearer, use the tense and the voice that are easiest to understand.</li>
						<li>If you are writing about past or future events, do not use the present tense. It will just be confusing. </li>

				<h3>Pattern: Do not use double negatives or clauses inside clauses </h3>
				<p>Use a simple sentence structure. Do not use a double negative to express a positive.  Do not use clauses inside clauses that can be confusing.</p>
				<p>For example, more people will understand “You must get the agency’s approval before we can answer your claim”: rather than “No approval of any claims can be achieved without the agency’s approval”.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>This benefits many people including those with language impairments, learning disabilities or a poor memory.  For example, a person with early stage dementia can manage their own appointments and affairs because the language is clear and understandable.</p>

				<h3>Pattern: Use literal language: </h3>
				<p>Use literal and concrete language.  When possible, use concrete terms and examples that refer to objects or events that you can see, hear or touch.  </p>
				<p>Metaphors and similes should not be used unless they are explained. You can explain any non literal language:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>In  simple language in brackets next to any non-literal text (such as a Metaphors and similes)</li>
					<li>As a pop up definition</li>
					<li>In supported mark up (see aui-literal) </li>
				</ul>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>Many people do not understand non literal content. For example, a programmer with autism spectrum disorder may not understand jokes and similes.

				<h3>Pattern: Separate each instruction</h3>
				<p>In Instructions, separate each step. It makes it much easier to follow. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Using numbers and lists can also help</li>
					<li>Sometimes complex instructions can be easier to follow in an If/Then table</li>
					<li>Using a friendly graphics can help make instructions less scary</li>
				</ul>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>This benefits many people including those with language impairments, learning disabilities or a poor memory. </p>
					<p>For example, a person with a low working memory can not hold onto many pieces of information at the same time. If they need to remember what they are doing, divide the steps and track what they have done they are much more likely to make mistakes.  When instructions are clearly separated and clearly laid they can follow them without making mistakes.</p>
				</section>

				<h3>Pattern: Keep text succinct</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Keep paragraphs short. Have only one topic in each paragraph.</li>
					<li>Use short sentences. Have only one point per sentence.</li>
					<li>Use bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
					<li>Use bullets or numbered lists.</li>
				</ul>
				<section>
					<h4>How It Helps </h4>
					<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">Chunking</a> text content makes it easier to read and understand. People with poor memory or anyone who is easily distracted will benefit too. This also helps people with learning disabilities related to processing speed or language. Chunking is helpful to anyone who is multitasking.</p>
					<p>Example: a graduate student with ADD may need to teach themselves a new software skill. The software documentation is broken up into short paragraphs and lists by topic. The student finds the documentation easy to read and understand.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More Details</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>What is a short paragraph? </strong>In English, if you have a paragraph of more than 50 words, see if it could be broken up into two paragraphs. </li>
						<li><strong>How can I avoid writing a sentence with more than one point? </strong>Sentences that have more than one point usually have more than one linking word such as ‘and’ or ‘but’.</li>
						<li><strong>Can a long sentence ever be clearer than two short sentences? </strong>Double-check if a long sentence is clearer than two short sentences. Do usability testing to see if people with cognitive disabilities find the long sentence easier to understand.</li>
						<li><strong>When should I use lists? </strong>Lists are great when you have three or more things in a row. Think about using an unordered list (with bullet points) for items, requirements, and exceptions. A series of three or more steps is easier to follow as a numbered list. </li>

					<h4>Examples</h4>
					<p><strong>Success Example </strong></p>
					<p>Calgary will have a lot of snow and hail this weekend. Try not to drive. If you must drive: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Use the rules for driving in winter to keep safe.  </li>
						<li>Before you leave, check what roads are safe at the Traveler’s Information Website.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Failure Example </strong></p>
					<p>DOTD Issues Winter Weather Travel Advisory for Calgary. With the possibility of snow and rain in the forecast throughout the holiday weekend, the Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) announced that department staff is prepared to deal with winter weather. Maintenance forces will be on standby to apply sand and salt over any affected bridges and roadways, to remove fallen trees from the roadway, and to close any roads as needed. Interim Secretary Jane Doe urges motorists to take the threat of winter weather seriously. "In the event of adverse weather conditions, the department will strive to maintain access to highways and interstates; however, we encourage the motoring public to avoid traveling during snow and ice, if at all possible," said Doe. During winter weather conditions, the best thing motorists can do is drive slowly and carefully, and avoid driving while distracted. Always allow for extra driving time, reduce speeds when visibility is low, and make sure there is plenty of room between vehicles. Also, look out for black ice, which can form on bridges, overpasses, off- ramps and in shady spots. As always, DOTD reminds motorists to buckle up and refrain from drinking and driving. Citizens can get the latest updates on real-time traffic and road conditions by using the Traveler Information System simply by dialing ### from their telephone and saying the route or region about which they are seeking information. Travelers can also access this information by visiting the Traveler Information Website. Motorists can also obtain information regarding road closures by contacting DOTD’s Customer Service Center at (1-###-###-####). The center is open 7:30 a.m.- 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.</p>

				<h3>Use white spacing</h3>
				<p>Put white space around objects and text, including boxes, paragraph headings, and content, so that each section is clearly separated. </p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>White space (also called negative space or the background color) reduces clutter and provides definition to content. This gives the viewer a clear overview of a web page. It is used by designers to enhance text and the position of objects on a page.</p>
					<p>Use of white space aids navigation through a page and helps people read it. It can help the user find important elements on a page. For those with cognitive impairments, it has been shown to ease reading difficulties and improves understanding of content.</p>
					<p>Also, make sure the user can also adjust the amount of white space around objects and text via a web extension or user setting. This supports the ability to identify important elements in the content of a web page.</p>

				<h3>Pattern: Use clear and accurate text formatting and punctuation</h3>
				<p>Use the correct punctuation for text, numbers and symbols to improve readability and comprehension.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>For some readers, decoding words, numbers and symbols is not automatic task and can be demanding on working memory and executive functions. If they find content too demanding they are at risk of losing its meaning and the overall context of the message you intend to convey. Some users may use assistive technology or personalization tools to reduce the cognitive demands of decoding content. This can be text to speech that reads aloud content which reduces the cognitive burden and present content in multiple sensory channels. </p>
					<p>Users should not need to spend extra cognitive function deciphering letters, numbers, and words, and can focus on understanding the meaning of the content, particularly when they are using assistive technology or personalizing content. It is important the content is created with these adaptations in mind, to ensure that all users gain the experience you want them to receive. Content creators should ensure that content is read correctly with assistive technology and can be personalized without losing simple content. </p>
					<p>Use cases:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>“I listen to content so I need it to be announced and phrased correctly so I can understand it.”</li>
						<li>“I listen to content and I hear content read incorrectly or skipped, particularly numbers and symbols.”</li>
						<li>“If text, numbers or symbols are in an unfamiliar layout, I get really confused.”</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<p><strong>Use punctuation correctly</strong> for the language you are writing in, as it will affect how the stress and intonation (known as the prosody) of the text when converted into speech. For example, in English, commas and semicolons will result in a short pause in the speech, where as a hyphen – will generally be ignored. Question marks, exclamation marks and speech marks can result in changes in intonation.</p>
					<p><strong>Avoid the use of Roman Numerals and unfamiliar symbols</strong> in text were possible. These can confuse readers and are likely to be read incorrectly by text to speech tools. If these symbols are necessary then ensure they are marked up correctly using techniques such as [link] and Roman Numerals should always be presented as capitals.</p>
					<p>Be aware that long numbers may be read as single digits or phrased as a single number. This is a particular problem for phone numbers or zip codes. While it is difficult to control exactly how these numbers are read aloud, content creators can help by:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Displaying the content of the number and using HTML semantics to ensure users and assistive technologies are aware of numbers purpose. In addition the following recommendations can assist with improving text to speech rendering:
							<li>For phone numbers, use the correct layout for the locality of the phone number and ensure users can select the whole phone number including area codes as text to speech voices can often then recognise the format and phrase it correctly.</li>
							<li>For Zip / Postal codes, including state or address information close to the number so that speech voices can expand known abbreviations (such as state names) and listeners can perceive the context.</li>
						</li>
						<li>When writing long numbers, consider what separators will be familiar to your readers and how it will be read aloud. In general, English speaking countries will use commas between thousands and a period as the decimal separator whereas German and other European countries do the opposite. For example, 1,245 would represent one thousand two hundred and forty five in English but one point two four five in German. Text to speech output will assume the separators are being used in the format of the language of its voice. If this does not match the content then listeners can become easily confused. While replacing thousand separators with a space has become a common convention to avoid confusion, it leads to difficulties with text to speech as long numbers are read out disjointly. For example, 120 034 943 can be read as one hundred and twenty, zero three four, nine hundred and forty three. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>Consider how you write dates as the text to speech will use the format associated with the language of the voice. A date such as 04/03/2019 will be read as “April 3rd 2019” by a US English voice and “4th of March 2019” by a British English voice. Writing out the month in words can avoid confusion.</p>

				<h3>Provide summary of long documents</h3>
				<p>Provide a brief summary for a long document and emphasize any import keywords to help people understand the purpose and contents of the document, and if it might contain information they need.</p>
				<p>Summaries should use common words, short sentences and be written in an easy to understand style and tense.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>Making the summary easy to understand helps many people to quickly decide if the document is relevant to them and their current goal. In this case, a very high level outline in a few sentences or bullet points is most effective.  Abstracts and executive summaries are usually much longer and more detailed as they are designed to summarise the entire document. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<p>Long Documents have 300 words or more.</p>
					<p>In general headings are used to break the information down into a more manageable size and provide structure to the information being presented. This particularly benefits users of Assistive Technology. The first section should be a text summary of the document. It may include links to other sections if appropriate.</p>
					<p>Providing a text summary that can be understood by people with lower secondary education level reading ability. For pieces of content with less than 300 words the heading may act as an abstract.</p>
					<p>See the theme in understandable text for the minimum on how to write an understandable summary. User testing is recommended.</p>

				<h3>Pattern: Provide Alternatives for numbers</h3>
				<p>Provide alternatives for numbers and numerical concepts.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>How it helps</h4>
					<p>Not all people can understand numbers and numerical concepts.</p>
					<p>For example, some people have dyscalculia, a learning disability specifically-related to mathematics. People with dyscalculia have significant problems with numbers and mathematical concepts, but still have a normal or above-normal IQ. </p>
					<p>For example, a user with dyscalculia may have difficulty processing temperature data when presented only in a numeric format. However, if non-numeric alternatives are provided (cold, warm, hot etc.) then they are able to understand the content.</p>
					<p>Numeracy issues can occur due to a range of disabilities, the most severe being the inability to read or understand numbers. Other people have challenges with any calculations such as relative sizes or times. When reading measurement an individual with cognitive impairment may understand the concept of 90cms as a length but find it hard to cope with the fact that 0.9m and 900mm are the same length. </p>
					<p>For example, a train schedule has a long list of relative times that they train leaves for different zones on the hour. The user can not calculate when the next train leaves from their location.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>More details</h4>
					<p>Where an understanding of mathematics is not a primary requirement for using this content use one of the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Reinforce numbers with non-numerical concepts, e.g., Very Cold, Cold, Cool, Mild, Warm, Hot, Very Hot</li>
						<li>Using personalization semantics to supply  a non-numerical concepts (when mature ) See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/personalization-semantics/wiki">Personalization Semantics Wiki</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/personalization-semantics/help/index.html#numberfree-explanation">data-numberfree</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>It should be noted that different users may find math easier to understand than long text.</p>
					<p>Where some math skills are essential for the content:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Move towards digital math that can be extended (not numbers in images)</li>
						<li>Enable highlighting of sections as they are being discussed</li>
						<li>Link sections of numbers to extra help that can be read together</li>
						<li>Enable replacing math sections with words or summaries for users who prefer this.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Content that may need extra support include understanding what the representation of a number may mean as a concept of:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>size</li>
						<li>quantity</li>
						<li>distance</li>
						<li>time</li>
						<li>date</li>
						<li>temperature</li>
						<li>positive/negative</li>
						<li>calculation</li>
						<li>sequencing</li>
						<li>memory</li>
						<li>cultural differences</li>
						<li>alternative representation</li>
